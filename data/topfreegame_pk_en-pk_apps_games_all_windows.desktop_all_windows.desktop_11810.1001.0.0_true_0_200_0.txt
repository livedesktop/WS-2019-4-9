Recall your childhood!\r\n\r\nLudo game that traces its lineage to 6th century India. Ludo is derived from game Pachisi. Ludo is also very similar to Spanish board game.\r\n\r\nLudo game has stayed popular throughout the ages, varying only a little in its game structure. This persevering game is now available for you to play in an all new modernized format, i.e. as a video game application.\r\n\r\nThe game is played between 2 to 4 players and you have the option of playing the game against the computer, against your friends, or even against people from around the world. The objective of the game is pretty straightforward; each player gets 4 tokens, these tokens must make a full turn of the board and then make it to the finish line.\r\n\r\nWhoever gets all four tokens to the end first is the winner. However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided die, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a six. Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player’s token lands on the same square as your token, then your token will automatically be sent back home and you’ll need to roll a six again.\r\n\r\nLudo King is a game that was played by kings and now it can be enjoyed by you and your family and friends. While the game play might seem simple at first, the game is immensely enjoyable and challenging. You’ll be playing this one for hours and its fun for the whole family. Try to beat your opponents and compete for the highest scores on the leaderboards.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PMVVJ8ZWMXS","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Real Racing Nitro Asphalt 3D","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41959.14285761715223747.4bc70807-9cbf-4ec1-91ef-377318b127a6.d5efe1ae-1616-4006-9a28-fcaa5de2f237","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14335.14285761715223747.03bae1e2-6ae3-446c-8eb4-ea276a312aec.4b016c12-fa41-4e39-86f2-d4abae8abfde","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41959.14285761715223747.4bc70807-9cbf-4ec1-91ef-377318b127a6.d5efe1ae-1616-4006-9a28-fcaa5de2f237","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.6,"RatingsCount":"13","PackageFamilyNames":["59192DragonPokeGames.48032C0D0FC90_dqa1dx3zdn60e"],"ContentIds":["a7afa0e9-4f66-ab28-2059-b36bbbe6fb17"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Real Racing Nitro Asphalt 3D takes the racing & car driving genre to a whole new level by adding an addictive extreme car racing, stunning graphics and the most realistic car physics ever!

Enter and put your skills to the test. If you're sharp, you'll clear the table in no time and show your opponent who the true champ is in 8 Ball Pool game!\r\nWhen you get busy in your life and also want to try something new , we are here with the royal game of this world, 8 Ball Pool . This online game is right at your fingertips and you can play it anywhere anytime. \r\nBilliards or Pool is evolved from a lawn game similar to croquet played sometime during the 15th century in Northern Europe.\r\nThe  goal in 8 Ball Pool live is to pocket all 7 of your ‘suited’ balls, stripes or solids and then pot the black 8-ball. \r\nPlayer's ‘suit’ is determined by the first ball pocketed by you or your opponent. To shoot, aim your cue at the colored ‘object’ ball you wish to hit. Keep an eye on the Power Meter in the bottom left corner of the play area. \r\nYou can also add spin to the cue ball by clicking on the large cue ball icon in the top right corner of the play area which indicates the part of the white ball surface that you will hit.\r\nHowever 8 Ball Pool game is so interesting and you can play it by your own tricks, you just have to hit the ball with the stick and there are six pots to get in for goal. You have to collect the coins for this game and this can be used to get tables and buy new sticks that have more power. \r\nThis ultimate Online game is played between two players who either choose Solids or Stripes. The Player who choose solids has to strike only the Solid color balls which are numbered 1 to 7 and vice versa. If a user makes a foul or scratch while playing his chance the ball will be passed to the other player along with the white ball in his hands, which he can place anywhere on the table and can play any shot he wants , once the player is finished plotting the black ball into the pocket, the game ends.

10!\r\n\r\nSolitaire remains the most played computer game of all time, and for good reason. Simple rules and straightforward gameplay make it easy to pick up for everyone.\r\n\r\nSolitaire has been part of Windows for more than 25 years, and the Microsoft Solitaire Collection makes it the best experience to date with five different card games in one:\r\n\r\nKlondike\r\nThis version is the timeless classic that many people just call \"Solitaire.\" Try to clear all the cards from the table using one or three-card draw, while using traditional scoring or the Vegas scoring system.\r\n\r\nSpider\r\nEight columns of cards await your attempts to clear them with the fewest moves possible. Start out playing with a single suit until you’re comfortable, and then see how you fare when using two or even all four suits in a game.\r\n\r\nFreeCell\r\nUse four extra cells to move cards around as you try to clear all cards from the table. More strategic than the Klondike version, FreeCell rewards players who think several moves ahead.\r\n\r\nTriPeaks\r\nSelect cards in a sequence, either up or down, to earn points and clear the board. How many boards can you clear before you run out of deals?\r\n\r\nPyramid\r\nPair two cards that add up to 13 in order to remove them from the board. Try to reach the top of the pyramid. See how many boards you can clear and how high you can score in this highly addictive card game!\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges\r\nPlayers receive new challenges each day. Complete enough Daily Challenges in a month to earn badges and compete with your friends.\r\n\r\nStar Club\r\nEven more challenges arranged in collections and packs you can unlock by earning stars.\r\n\r\nChoose Your Theme\r\nThe Microsoft Solitaire Collection features several beautiful themes, from the simplicity of \"Classic\" to the serenity of an Aquarium that comes to life before you while you play. You can even create custom themes from your own photos!\r\n\r\nXbox Live Integration\r\nSign in with your Microsoft account to earn achievements, compete with your friends on the leaderboards, and track your personal gameplay statistics. If you sign in with a Microsoft account, your progress is stored in the cloud so you can play the game on any device without missing a beat!\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9MW71DR2BFQH","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Bubble Shooter POP!

In 1291 the Archbishop of Canterbury in England threatened clergy who continued playing Chess with a diet of bread and water.  \r\nThe game has flourished over the years and is now one of the most popular board games in the world, requiring thought, skill and strategy to become successful.\r\n\r\nThe object of Chess is to capture the opponent's King.  To capture the King you must place it in check.  If the King cannot escape by itself, or with the help of its army, it is in checkmate and the King is captured.\r\n \r\nZingMagic’s multi award winning Chess application supports over 20 levels of play allowing you to play moves or games against the clock or relax and play at your own pace. Whatever level of Chess you choose, you can be sure that ZingMagic’s Chess will give you a fun, stimulating and challenging game.\r\n\r\nThis game is ad-funded.
