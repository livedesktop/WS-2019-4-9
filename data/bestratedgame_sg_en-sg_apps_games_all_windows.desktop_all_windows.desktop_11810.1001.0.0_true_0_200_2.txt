A crime syndicate that operates in deep secrecy to steal the most valuable items around the world.\r\nAre you ready for a life of crime? Become our new recruit and download this action-packed stealth game now!\r\n\r\nJust some of the awesome features:\r\n⛬ Unique stealth play\r\nDynamics shadows and lights offering unique stealth experience\r\n⛬ Many cool gadgets to unlock\r\n ⚬ Night vision goggle\r\n ⚬ Thermal (heat) goggles\r\n ⚬ Stun gun\r\n ⚬ Electromagnetic pulse (EMP) weapons\r\n ⚬ Digital map\r\n ⚬ so much more to come\r\n⛬ Take-downs\r\nNeutralize guards and drag them out of sight\r\n⛬ Multiple campaigns with many missions\r\nSteal priceless items around the world in a full career-mode\r\n⛬ Control the environment\r\nDestroy lights, eliminate security cams\r\n\r\nThe art of stealth\r\nYou will need to operate in complete silence and remain undetected as you steal objects from the most secure locations. Avoid or neutralize guards, sneak past security cameras, and maneuver past anti-theft security laser pointer systems. It's all part of your daily occupation as a notorious thief.\r\n\r\nThe key to completing successful missions in this stealth game is remaining undetected. Use the shadows and any tiny corner to your advantage. You often have multiple options to a situation, will you take-down a guards or will you simply sneak by. While missions can be completed whilst detected, the true art of stealth is to achieve 100% stealth scores for your missions.\r\n\r\nGame-play TIPS\r\n1. Use the dark shadows\r\nWatch your stealth visibility indicator at the bottom/right of the screen closely to see how visible you are. By staying in the dark shadows you will remain invisible to the guards and this allows you to sneak past them undetected.\r\n2. Use gadgets wisely\r\nAs you complete missions you're arsenal of gadgets and gear expands, but your resources remain limited. Use your ammunition wisely throughout the missions as you may come cross critical situations when you will desperately need your weapons.\r\n3. Drag guards into the shadow\r\nTo avoid any later detection of knocked out guards you need to be sure to drag them out of sight into a dark corner or behind cover. Detection of a guards leads to the alarm being raised and will negatively impact your stealth % score.\r\n4. Be patient\r\nThey key to any stealth game is to be patient and observe the situation and then take measured and planning action accordingly.\r\n\r\nYour gadgets\r\nComplete missions and you will be rewarded by the syndicate with new high-tech gadgets allowing you to complete the most challenging heists against all odds. Pay close attention to the gadget training missions.\r\n\r\nThe jobs\r\nThis stealth game presents a simulation of the life of a pro modern criminal.

After ~30 games the true skill emerges. Even a beginner can beat an expert through luck of draw in a single game, but after several games the skill prevails.\r\n\r\nThis version of Backgammon uses an advanced neural network in the highest levels, and will challenge advanced players. It also offers a fun experience for beginners, with lower difficulty levels and showing possible moves.\r\n\r\nThe scoring is based on the official Backgammon ELO system, with each game increasing or reducing rating points every game or match.\r\n\r\nFEATURES:\r\n=========\r\n* Worldwide online high scores\r\n* Play a Trial Game, or a Scored Game that counts towards your score\r\n* High res graphic board\r\n* Dice statistics history\r\n* Real time probability calculation\r\n* Achievements\r\n* Tutorials\r\n* 4 difficulty levels: easy to hard\r\n* 1 or 2 player mode\r\n* Many options:\r\n    -

Drag and drops whole column, only suitable cards will move, others snap back. The game will move proper card to foundation whenever possible to minimize clicks, taps and drags. Three different difficulty modes to control how many cards being opened, how many deck turnovers allowed and if King (vs any card) is required to initialize empty pile.

Each stack must start with an Ace, followed by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen and end with a King. \r\n✓ At the beginning of the game, all the cards are dealt into 8 columns. At the top of the screen you will find 4 free cells and 4 foundations. Use the free cells to temporarily store one card at a time during the game.\r\n✓ Once you place a card in the foundation you cannot take it back. Make sure you no longer need it before placing it there.\r\n✓ You can move a card from one column to another if the top card from the other column is +1 higher and is of a different color. For example, you can put a 3 of hearts over a 4 of spades. Or you can put a 10 of clubs over a Jack of diamonds.\r\n✓ You can move an entire series of cards if you have enough free positions. Empty columns and empty free cells are considered free positions. The series of cards must be smaller or equal than the number of free positions plus 1. For example, if you have 2 empty free cells and one empty column you can move at most 4 cards at a time.\r\n✓ If you cannot move a stack because it is too large you can try splitting it into two parts. Then you can reassemble it in a new column.\r\n\r\n\r\n★ Support and Feedback\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

This tactical top-down shooter puts you in the shoes of specialist Burton in his hunt for dangerous fugitives after a disastrous prison break.\r\n\r\nTACTICAL COMBAT\r\nUse the environment to your advantage. Avoid attacks by taking cover. Flank enemies for extra efficiency, but avoid getting flanked yourself! Use the tools of the trade to gain an edge - frag grenades, flash bangs, distractions, personal shields, proximity mines and more.\r\n\r\nSTEALTH\r\nChoose your approach with care. Some say running into the fray guns blazing isn’t always the best option. Use distractions to single out opponents. Use disguises and covers to sneak past irrelevant guards. Use silenced weapons to covertly reduce the enemy numbers.\r\n\r\nLOAD-OUTS & GEAR\r\nChoosing your load-out is a big part of your tactics. In addition to body armor and grenades you can carry one two-handed and one single-handed weapon in each mission - and there’s something for everyone. Shotguns, handguns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, crossbows, energy weapons, throwing axes and more.\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH1ZLFF","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Death Race Stunt Moto","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1628.13510798886204228.cb720a9c-f662-4784-a718-2bdd50f42316.6864e1c2-cc63-4ae4-b201-7ed5d4d5c53b","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9084.13510798886204228.3c018560-9018-48e4-ba50-9c916845c2c9.0960fd61-0f24-4f2c-a7a7-5d6bf1bb00c7","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38727.13510798886204228.3dcfff6c-e233-4fc8-803d-c8ddd33d4909.3aa9e0b0-e258-4318-9658-02095834ce50","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["50154AVLogix.DeathRaceStuntMoto_q7ke2emr2nmbw"],"ContentIds":["c656c455-d835-5209-d9ed-5f9ba9d0a091","ed55a42f-5df2-1cc0-d92c-4d5fe8528a1d"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Strap on the helmet, pull over the safety guards and be prepared for the extreme race on the daredevil’s ride!

Use your cunning to kill or tame the primeval creatures roaming the land, and encounter other players to survive, dominate... and escape! \r\n\r\nTAME, TRAIN, BREED & RIDE DINOSAURS, IN A LIVING ECOSYSTEM\r\nOver 50 creatures can be tamed using a challenging subdue-&-protect process. Weaken a feral creature to knock it out, and then nursing it to health. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your Pet, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Pets continue to level-up and consume food, and carry Inventory and Equipment.  Fly a Pteranodon over the mountains, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, or chase down prey on a T-Rex! Experience a dynamic ecosystem with its own predator & prey hierarchies. Breed Pets through successive generations to generate the best traits. Or put more simply, breed & raise Dino Babies!\r\n\r\nFOOD, WATER, TEMPERATURE AND WEATHER\r\nEat and drink to survive, with different foods having different nutritional values (including human meat!). All actions drain food and water, and long-distance travel is draining. Inventory weight slows you down, and the day/night cycle and weather alter the environment. Craft clothing, build shelter, and use fire to protect yourself against damage & the elements.\r\n\r\nHARVEST, CRAFT, AND PAINT ITEMS\r\nHarvest trees, ore, and more to become a master crafter. Use your hands, a Smithy, or a Fabricator to craft increasingly complex and powerful gear. Build a massive base using modular pieces--ranging from Thatch, to Wood, to Stone, to Metal. Customize your base by painting it and placing signs that you can actually draw on. Weapons, clothing, & armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.\r\n\r\nSUMMON THE ULTIMATE LIFE FORMS\r\nBring rare items to special Summon locations to awaken the ARK’s mythical creatures, who arrive ready for battle. These monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced Tribes and their Pets, and yield valuable items if they are defeated.\r\n\r\nRPG STATISTICS\r\nLevel-Up your survivor by gaining experience through in-game actions to learn new crafting Engrams, or find higher level item Blueprints in the most dangerous parts of the ARK. Customize the look of your character with a complex character creation system.\r\n\r\nHARDCORE MECHANICS\r\nItems have durability and wear out with use if not repaired. When you leave the game, your character remains “sleeping” in the persistent world. Your inventory also exists in the persistent world, vulnerable to theft. Death means permanent loss, and you can even enslave other players for your own purposes.\r\n\r\nLARGE WORLD PERSISTENCE\r\nOn the 70+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your pets stay in-game even when you leave. Special themed events will occur in the world with corresponding limited-run items!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH58H7C","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Traffic Moto Racing 3D","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51283.13510798886908206.d3773cdc-c9a6-402a-a06c-d9b7a5edd57d.99fff4f5-1bc2-4e25-9b3b-1fdc87462139","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9661.13510798886908206.88b31626-f79d-4814-ae35-93ecfc9a1e9a.f9210d0a-d9aa-4598-9295-dac4a22ef271","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46070.13510798886908206.039378c0-98aa-4292-8645-3e24ce4e9657.9987c8b0-6dc1-40b5-a997-a2d98fdd5c71","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27495.13510798886908206.d72b143e-ec29-42a7-bccc-8301cff80374.7f927445-9361-490e-8cf3-978a24d576b8","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["61668ZEKAB.TrafficMotoRacing3D_2s8ag80cwb2t8"],"ContentIds":["1277da72-0f12-b1c5-3b4e-75ef7eb0e29f","f2f98fa8-20d8-0744-2c2c-8ac47f92b3fc"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Let’s download and enjoy the fully featured Traffic Moto Racing 3D game from Window Store at your window device for free.
