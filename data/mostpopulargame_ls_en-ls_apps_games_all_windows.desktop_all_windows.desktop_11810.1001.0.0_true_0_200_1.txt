A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line. Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans.\r\n\r\nIt’s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. It’s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control. Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. Highly skilled drivers control a high powered street car past its limit, sideways at high speed, burning rubber.

So, yep we mastered AI along time ago!\r\n\r\nRegardless of your playing level, ZingMagic's multi award winning Chess is a fun, stimulating and challenging game for beginners and champions alike.\r\n\r\nChess is a two player game with a colourful history which can be traced back to its Indian ancestor, Chaturanga. In 1291 the Archbishop of Canterbury in England threatened clergy who continued playing Chess with a diet of bread and water.  \r\nThe game has flourished over the years and is now one of the most popular board games in the world, requiring thought, skill and strategy to become successful.\r\n\r\nThe object of Chess is to capture the opponent's King.  To capture the King you must place it in check.  If the King cannot escape by itself, or with the help of its army, it is in checkmate and the King is captured.\r\n \r\nZingMagic’s multi award winning Chess application supports over 20 levels of play allowing you to play moves or games against the clock or relax and play at your own pace. Whatever level of Chess you choose, you can be sure that ZingMagic’s Chess will give you a fun, stimulating and challenging game.\r\n\r\nThis game is ad-funded.

This is the most complete and realistic RC simulator available!\r\n\r\nNote: we are constantly adding more, you will see them listed when you install the program!\r\n\r\nThe program includes different flying fields, boat and car race tracks.\r\n\r\nWe also includes 3 interactive object sets that can be loaded on any flying field. The interactive objects can be used for learning landing and precise model control. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the fixed point camera that represents the RC pilot point of view, we have included follow up camera that allows for walking behind the model. That is useful when you just start, so the model never gets away. \r\n\r\nPlease try our full featured professional RC flight simulator ClearView for PC here: http://rcflightsim.com - see the video of ClearView bellow.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n1. This is not a game. You are controlling flying rc models that reacts like real flying models. It takes some time to learn, and again, do not expect \"arcade\" style controls. \r\n2. The onscreen control sticks are just indicators! They are made small so they do not obscure the screen. \r\n\r\n*** You do not need to keep your fingers on them *** \r\n\r\nSliding your finger any where on the right screen half affects the right control stick , the same for the left screen part - sliding finger there moves the left control stick. \r\n\r\nWe suggest to select beginner settings at first few days before you can comfortably progress further.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJ1LV","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Cricket 3D World Street Challenge","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41935.9007199266244237.5818d65e-20b9-4ef8-9b03-260b26c1f348.3654212a-edc0-42cf-aa02-762e8b9a02eb","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#F2F5A9","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39839.9007199266244237.5e0d85a0-ba41-4d45-af73-9a9bf8aa6366.4d9ed70d-58cc-4fe2-9c7c-43c466f8c0e2","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#F2F5A9","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["DumaduGamesPvtLtd.Cricket3DWorldStreetChallenge_19bhvy30nxe8w"],"ContentIds":["17967510-c97f-103e-31ec-f36053500510","af863a5e-1f0c-8978-dc33-04a95325d9eb"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Grab the helmet, tighten those pads and pull up your socks for some deadly strokes and shots in this Cricket 3D - World Street Cricket game!

Survival Games! An epic action game filled with unimaginable battles in full, 3D pixelated graphics awaits you in the ruins of an ancient civilization where it's either kill or be killed. \r\n\r\nTrapped in the wilds of a remote jungle village lurks one of the world's most powerful and deadly clans known to exist. Thought only a myth, you've since discovered that their brutal rituals have unleashed havoc on the ruins of an old religious temple and burial ground. Sensing your presence, mighty warriors that once defended the island from outsiders such as yourself have risen again to annihilate the threat to their remote location. The hell gates have opened and a flood of demon foes have spilled fourth to hunt you down courtesy of the witch doctor who wants your head on a platter.\r\n\r\nIn a world overrun with the dead, your mission is one of survival. Battle legendary enemies and discover a world full of diverse challenges. The ultimate FPS showdown is at hand and you must tear through waves of enemies with only one goal--your death. Test your skills, plan your moves, and above all, reserve your shots or risk losing everything. The epic action of this first person shooter action game is one of legendary proportions and now you are in the midst of it. Battle your way to victory and discover the secrets these clansmen hold close.
