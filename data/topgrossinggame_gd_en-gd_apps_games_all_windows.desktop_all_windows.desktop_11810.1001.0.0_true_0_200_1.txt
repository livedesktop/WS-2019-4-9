Backgammon is a board game in which you move the pieces around the board according to dice rolls. Once you get all the pieces in the house you take them out according to your dice. The first player to get all the pieces out wins the game.\r\nDownload and play now!\r\n\r\n\r\n‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ FEATURES ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ \r\n\r\n‚úì challenging AI\r\n\r\n‚úì auto bear off\r\n\r\n‚úì easy to select and move pieces\r\n\r\n‚úì fluid animations \r\n\r\n‚úì HD graphics\r\n\r\n‚úì detailed statistics\r\n\r\n‚úì nice music and sound effects\r\n\r\n‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ TIPS ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ \r\n\r\n‚úì Your pieces are white and your opponent's pieces are black. There are 24 places on the board and two places to deposit the pieces. The 24 places are represented as triangles and called points. So the 1-point is the first place where pieces can stay. \r\n\r\n‚úì The points from 1 to 6 are called the opponents‚Äô home and the points from 19 to 24 are your home on the board. The opponent needs to bring all his pieces in the home region in order to take them out and so do you.\r\n\r\n‚úì You can move around the board in one direction. You move from the bottom-right corner to the bottom-left corner then to the top-left corner and finally to the top-right corner on a path that resembles a horseshoe. The points from 1 to 24 follow this path in the same direction. Your opponent moves in the opposite direction following this path. \r\n\r\n‚úì The game starts with a couple of dice rolls that decide which player should begin first. The opponent rolls first, then you. The one with the biggest pips‚Äô count on the dice starts first. A pip is a dot on the face of a dice which counts as a point of movement or placement.\r\n\r\n‚úì When your turn comes you start by rolling the dice and continue by making the moves.\r\n\r\n‚úì If you roll a double your pips count will be twice the pipsÔøΩÔøΩ sum of the dice.\r\n\r\n‚úì After you roll the dice some top pieces on your triangles, will be highlighted. You can start your move with any of those highlighted pieces. To move the pieces, you select the piece by tapping on the triangle on which it lies. Then, at that point the triangle turns blue and the places to which you can move next turn green. Tap on any of those green triangles to initiate the move. When the move ends and if there are moves left on the dice new pieces will be highlighted.\r\n\r\n‚úì If one of your dice is one you can move one of your pieces only one position. If the piece lies on 2-point you can move it on 3-point for example. If you roll a double, you can make four moves with the same value of the dice from that roll.\r\n\r\n‚úì You can move your pieces to columns occupied by your pieces, to empty places or places in which your opponent has one piece. \r\n\r\n‚úì If you move your piece over the opponent's single piece you can capture it.\r\n\r\n\r\n‚òÖ Support and Feedback\r\n\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

While there were other text based computer games before Adventure like STARTREK (incidentally our first release - Star Trek Classic), this was the first text based \"interactive fiction\" game.  \r\n\r\nThe game was created by Will Crowther, a caving enthusiast, who combined a faithful simulation of his cave explorations and elements of fantasy role playing (he was a fan of Dungeons and Dragons), to create an adventure game for his daughters. The game was later expanded and improved in collaboration with Don Woods who introduced additional fantasy elements like elves and a troll.\r\n\r\nThis is a faithful reproduction of the original game, ported to work on your Windows device. Here is how the game's introduction starts:\r\n\r\n\"Somewhere nearby is Colossal Cave, where others have found fortunes in treasure and gold, though it is rumored that some who enter are never seen again.

Starting with Windows 98 other version of solitaire joined the suit - FreeCell, Spider, Tri-Peaks and Pyramid. As a part of the standard Windows installation those games have been popularized around the world. For each of those games millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We combined all six games (Klondike, Spider, FreeCell, Tri-Peaks and two flavors of Pyramid) in a tiny download package. \r\n\r\nThe fun of original games is preserved but some improvement are made to make it easier to play on the small factor devices.

M.A.S.H. stands for mansion, apartment, shack, and house. The game revolves around the most common categories: the car, the kind of house, the partner, and the number of children. A spiral is drawn, and the number of times that spiral crosses a line determines the amount of rotations used per round. After each rotation,  the word that you land on is crossed off. By the end of the game, you will have 1 words left in each category. This is considered the player's future. The objects in each category may be negative (e.g. someone the person does not like as a partner, something like a Yugo as a car) however some may be positive (e.g. someone the person does like as a partner, something like a Ferrari as a car).","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDMLVN","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Bad Nerd - School RPG","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42124.9007199266448791.fa0f079b-e09a-4f6f-b62c-750d93c49e04.c67d47ed-c550-4153-b2ca-abd4c540ad7f","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37851.9007199266448791.38f4e3d1-2a40-46ed-8922-da8f66fc0a8f.b25a6a7b-fec8-494f-97ad-6d2dd7054196","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["VNLEntertainmentLtd.BadNerd-SchoolRPG_xaadq54jk5f4e"],"ContentIds":["9c1b78c6-a5f1-37dc-2e3a-5e8b7dfc5188","1bc338f0-29e1-673b-8b47-bd665e2370be"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"Ó±é Ó£™","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"NOTE: This game requires touch input and does not support mouse and keyboard.\r\n\r\nSee a nerd unleash the nerd rage like never before!\r\n\r\nIf you are a fan of modern action RPGs with lots of fighting then you will love Bad Nerd!\r\nJoin Bad Nerd in his quest to rid the school of bullies!

10!\r\n\r\nSolitaire remains the most played computer game of all time, and for good reason. Simple rules and straightforward gameplay make it easy to pick up for everyone.\r\n\r\nSolitaire has been part of Windows for more than 25 years, and the Microsoft Solitaire Collection makes it the best experience to date with five different card games in one:\r\n\r\nKlondike\r\nThis version is the timeless classic that many people just call \"Solitaire.\" Try to clear all the cards from the table using one or three-card draw, while using traditional scoring or the Vegas scoring system.\r\n\r\nSpider\r\nEight columns of cards await your attempts to clear them with the fewest moves possible. Start out playing with a single suit until you‚Äôre comfortable, and then see how you fare when using two or even all four suits in a game.\r\n\r\nFreeCell\r\nUse four extra cells to move cards around as you try to clear all cards from the table. More strategic than the Klondike version, FreeCell rewards players who think several moves ahead.\r\n\r\nTriPeaks\r\nSelect cards in a sequence, either up or down, to earn points and clear the board. How many boards can you clear before you run out of deals?\r\n\r\nPyramid\r\nPair two cards that add up to 13 in order to remove them from the board. Try to reach the top of the pyramid. See how many boards you can clear and how high you can score in this highly addictive card game!\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges\r\nPlayers receive new challenges each day. Complete enough Daily Challenges in a month to earn badges and compete with your friends.\r\n\r\nStar Club\r\nEven more challenges arranged in collections and packs you can unlock by earning stars.\r\n\r\nChoose Your Theme\r\nThe Microsoft Solitaire Collection features several beautiful themes, from the simplicity of \"Classic\" to the serenity of an Aquarium that comes to life before you while you play. You can even create custom themes from your own photos!\r\n\r\nXbox Live Integration\r\nSign in with your Microsoft account to earn achievements, compete with your friends on the leaderboards, and track your personal gameplay statistics.

Or put more simply, breed & raise Dino Babies!\r\n\r\nFOOD, WATER, TEMPERATURE AND WEATHER\r\nEat and drink to survive, with different foods having different nutritional values (including human meat!). All actions drain food and water, and long-distance travel is draining. Inventory weight slows you down, and the day/night cycle and weather alter the environment. Craft clothing, build shelter, and use fire to protect yourself against damage & the elements.\r\n\r\nHARVEST, CRAFT, AND PAINT ITEMS\r\nHarvest trees, ore, and more to become a master crafter. Use your hands, a Smithy, or a Fabricator to craft increasingly complex and powerful gear. Build a massive base using modular pieces--ranging from Thatch, to Wood, to Stone, to Metal. Customize your base by painting it and placing signs that you can actually draw on. Weapons, clothing, & armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.\r\n\r\nSUMMON THE ULTIMATE LIFE FORMS\r\nBring rare items to special Summon locations to awaken the ARK‚Äôs mythical creatures, who arrive ready for battle. These monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced Tribes and their Pets, and yield valuable items if they are defeated.\r\n\r\nRPG STATISTICS\r\nLevel-Up your survivor by gaining experience through in-game actions to learn new crafting Engrams, or find higher level item Blueprints in the most dangerous parts of the ARK. Customize the look of your character with a complex character creation system.\r\n\r\nHARDCORE MECHANICS\r\nItems have durability and wear out with use if not repaired. When you leave the game, your character remains ‚Äúsleeping‚Äù in the persistent world. Your inventory also exists in the persistent world, vulnerable to theft. Death means permanent loss, and you can even enslave other players for your own purposes.\r\n\r\nLARGE WORLD PERSISTENCE\r\nOn the 70+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your pets stay in-game even when you leave. Special themed events will occur in the world with corresponding limited-run items!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4X6T9","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Forza Horizon 3 Standard Edition","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4458.13510798887550312.1152921504704380324.3a10922a-e559-46bf-8fb4-a273279585b6","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"#FFFFFF","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15767.13510798887550312.1152921504704377460.e0e88452-19d8-488c-bd67-b1e62c14728c","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"#FFFFFF","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58425.13510798887550312.1152921504704377148.5ba983ef-4617-4dec-962c-03bd855030ba","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"#FFFFFF","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$39.99‚Å∫","Price":39.99,"AverageRating":1.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":[""],"ContentIds":[],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"Ó±é Ó¶ê","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Xbox One","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Xbox One X Enhanced with native 4K support.

An old-school turn-based battle system combines with inspiration from Central European mythology to offer an RPG experience that feels unique yet also familiar.\r\n\r\nWhere History Meets Legend\r\nOperencia is home to an intriguing mix of unexplored mythology and fantastical versions of actual historical locations (e.g., Deva Fortress, Balvanyos) and characters (e.g., Attila, Seven Chieftains of the Magyars), all coming together to form one cohesive new gaming universe. Several of your own seven party members take influence from heroes of forgotten tales told hundreds of years ago, such as the brave knight Mezey and Sebastian the Dragon Slayer. \r\n\r\nA Tale for the Ages\r\nAn unknown force has abducted the Sun King Napkiraly, leaving Operencia in a state of perpetual darkness ‚Äì and eventual doom. From hidden royal tombs and cursed castles to an ascent up the World Tree to reach the Copper Forest of the Land of the Gods, explore diverse settings throughout the far reaches of the land‚Ä¶and beyond. Each location boasts its own unique atmosphere, visual style, level design and puzzles, and many take place entirely outdoors. \r\n\r\nBeautiful Presentation\r\nBreathtaking hand-drawn cutscenes and fabulous 2D character portraits bring the story to life in a style not easily compared to any other game. More than 30 colorful roles are fully voiced through top-tier performances authentic to the game‚Äôs Central European roots. \r\n\r\nPuzzles Everywhere\r\nFrom intricate riddles to selecting the proper ingredients to craft new items, dozens of puzzles challenge your brainpower throughout all of Operencia.  \r\n\r\nClassic Gameplay and Exploration\r\nAlong with a deeply strategic turn-based battle system full of spells and special skills to execute, tile-based movement encourages thorough exploration of each area.

Simulator is the latest in goat simulation technology, bringing next-gen goat simulation to YOU. You no longer have to fantasize about being a goat, your dreams have finally come true! \r\n\r\nGameplay-wise, Goat Simulator is all about causing as much destruction as you possibly can as a goat. It has been compared to an old-school skating game, except instead of being a skater, you're a goat, and instead of doing tricks, you wreck stuff.

CITY. EVER.\r\n- Craft hundreds of unique, gorgeous buildings in your city and expand it from a tiny, peaceful town to a big, bustling metropolis.\r\n- Don‚Äôt forget to decorate your skyline by building famous landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, the Tower of London or the Tower of Pisa (there‚Äôs something for every tower fan) to elevate your city to the top tourist destinations.\r\n\r\nMeet your new family \r\n- Cartoon fans rejoice! Meet and collect tons of funny characters with their own unique personalities, like the portly Sergeant Cakemore, or the uber-macho builder guy, Forest Manly (whose real skill is the tiny bit too suggestive eyebrow raise).\r\n- Build a water tower. Check! Build a fire station. Check! But who‚Äôs going to drive the fire truck? Assigning citizens to jobs will help you optimize your city, but you can go even further! Send them on missions and they won‚Äôt come home empty handed or do favors for them so they would invite their friends too to fill your city!\r\n\r\nFusion is the way to go\r\n- The future: age of smart forks, exploding hover boards, even selfies! But now the 21st century lives up to its promise, with the ability to merge buildings into advanced skyscrapers and unlock specializations.\r\n- Unlocking each allows you to develop your city towards different directions and expand your collection with specialized buildings such as Sustainability, Commerce, Education and Entertainment. Choose which one suits your strategy best!\r\n\r\nThe grass is always greener‚Ä¶\r\n- But is it really? Find out by visiting the cities of your friends. Is your friend the best builder you know? Well, you can always ‚Äúborrow‚Äù a bit of their ideas to improve your game ‚Ä¶ sshhh, we won‚Äôt tell anyone‚Ä¶\r\n- In case you find yourself short on some crucial resources, visiting the Trade HQ
