10!\r\n\r\nSolitaire remains the most played computer game of all time, and for good reason. Simple rules and straightforward gameplay make it easy to pick up for everyone.\r\n\r\nSolitaire has been part of Windows for more than 25 years, and the Microsoft Solitaire Collection makes it the best experience to date with five different card games in one:\r\n\r\nKlondike\r\nThis version is the timeless classic that many people just call \"Solitaire.\" Try to clear all the cards from the table using one or three-card draw, while using traditional scoring or the Vegas scoring system.\r\n\r\nSpider\r\nEight columns of cards await your attempts to clear them with the fewest moves possible. Start out playing with a single suit until you’re comfortable, and then see how you fare when using two or even all four suits in a game.\r\n\r\nFreeCell\r\nUse four extra cells to move cards around as you try to clear all cards from the table. More strategic than the Klondike version, FreeCell rewards players who think several moves ahead.\r\n\r\nTriPeaks\r\nSelect cards in a sequence, either up or down, to earn points and clear the board. How many boards can you clear before you run out of deals?\r\n\r\nPyramid\r\nPair two cards that add up to 13 in order to remove them from the board. Try to reach the top of the pyramid. See how many boards you can clear and how high you can score in this highly addictive card game!\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges\r\nPlayers receive new challenges each day. Complete enough Daily Challenges in a month to earn badges and compete with your friends.\r\n\r\nStar Club\r\nEven more challenges arranged in collections and packs you can unlock by earning stars.\r\n\r\nChoose Your Theme\r\nThe Microsoft Solitaire Collection features several beautiful themes, from the simplicity of \"Classic\" to the serenity of an Aquarium that comes to life before you while you play. You can even create custom themes from your own photos!\r\n\r\nXbox Live Integration\r\nSign in with your Microsoft account to earn achievements, compete with your friends on the leaderboards, and track your personal gameplay statistics.

The rain was pouring down and lightning was striking the trees & mountains outside. Foster thought about his battalion and wondered where they are – the weather had made him loose his tracks. He tried to make plans to go out as soon as the weather gets better and regroup with his men and find his way out in this unknown valley.\r\n\r\nThe morning light brought with it calmness to the weather. It was still raining but it was possible to go out and look for his men and hunt for some food.\r\n\r\nIt is time to load up your sniper rifle and jump into the wilds. Play the role of Captain Foster and help him feed himself. You have one Elite Sniper Rifle which can be used for hunting but if you use your Elite shooting skills and successfully hunt some deer, you can buy high range sniper guns.\r\n\r\nTo kill a deer, simply find it with help of long range gun scope and follow deer’s tracks to take a clear headshot. Keep in mind though that you are among the wilds and trying to eat what would have ended up as the lion’s food. You have to hunt the deer before getting to the loins or you will lose the hunt and the lions can you.\r\n\r\nYou will see beautiful sceneries like wildlife, forest and mountains in the game and enjoy the sounds of weapons, lions, birds and family of Red & Mole dear's.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH1Z7TW","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Forza Horizon 3","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56315.13510798886196618.c69955b8-0c9f-4ed7-a431-3d447a97bc78.d261c045-1905-4431-8be9-08248a0fdfd4","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#222222","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64761.13510798886196618.50f5e180-67d1-476d-a4ef-174d6b220526.305ec856-672f-4db7-af88-3e5bade8c67d","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#222222","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35178.13510798886196618.8fb909fd-bb9c-4611-aa4e-03bade5ac8f0.492dbe98-0433-4b96-a60f-7d2ba7c3d753","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#222222","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4458.13510798886196618.298e2154-4100-40ae-bd88-68cc23b9269c.a9034108-464e-4db2-9132-fb7f7839eebe","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#222222","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15767.13510798886196618.7b563777-0837-4cb2-97f3-546ddb595198.3852efb4-2956-433f-a763-44732ac8338b","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58425.13510798886196618.b6116342-bb1b-4855-8304-88c1cb3e6050.cd8962ae-980f-4868-a494-49fd3f2bf104","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"StrikethroughPrice":"","DisplayPrice":"","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.9,"RatingsCount":"7","PackageFamilyNames":["Microsoft.OpusPG_8wekyb3d8bbwe"],"ContentIds":["a7f01538-3078-1241-16ad-b380ee274507","28f380ea-f8c6-287a-1753-83eccb5e296b","e24186ce-9f25-4898-8b70-013b4a4f3f21"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Xbox One","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Xbox One X Enhanced with native 4K support.

A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line. Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans.\r\n\r\nIt’s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. It’s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control. Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. Highly skilled drivers control a high powered street car past its limit, sideways at high speed, burning rubber. It can’t get any better!\r\n____________________________________\r\n\r\nSUPPORT: http://en.ratrodstudio.com/support/ \r\nVISIT US: http://ratrodstudio.com\r\nFOLLOW US: twitter.com/ratrodstudio","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJB5L","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Age of Empires®: Castle Siege","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.11341.9007199266252647.baf236b1-ae09-487f-bdbf-6ffdc744742c.d910e55a-cdfb-43e1-9318-3c7d66bfb666","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#003a3c","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.24427.9007199266252647.9ba324ce-4f10-4494-b514-3359cbb64efe.d3afa0e4-400b-4def-8604-30ff6c7d4b21","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#003a3c","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.25315.9007199266252647.3a4528cf-5fb4-4dc6-91d4-2d7ad944aecd.7dfa01e2-0421-46f1-add5-95a3074818de","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#003a3c","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.28895.9007199266252647.0ea1d55b-c3df-4dc8-b60c-a8d40e17fd30.8f04f316-48af-4055-ae55-35e7ac66ecb9","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#003a3c","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.4919.9007199266252647.bb286170-3063-4cb8-b130-128244b2df65.fb7eac64-3411-4747-8d4d-00796f03b727","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#003a3c","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.17296.9007199266252647.89d45da1-4a51-4606-b1e2-3c015220fc07.4a8ed85a-4050-473b-8bef-d15c6c321815","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#003a3c","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.12627.9007199266252647.366d1d2e-522f-4faf-9e68-a3e32ab5c728.913e3f70-561f-411b-ac77-0aefe1ed886c","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#003a3c","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.5,"RatingsCount":"10","PackageFamilyNames":["Microsoft.AgeCastles_8wekyb3d8bbwe"],"ContentIds":["08818151-8f47-79a6-3f4a-4423522ce99a","9b991a7d-cc48-5730-1d73-8749e3a0e92e","8a25c808-c9ac-bc95-d648-e1b115e31b9e","97df42e3-1a1a-7d4d-50d3-ea6bc63829cd"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Age of Empires®: Castle Siege invites you to guide your empire through the Medieval Era on your Windows PC or touch screen device.

In this derby simulator limiting car damage is key to becoming victorious and how you smash into other cars makes a big difference.

In 1291 the Archbishop of Canterbury in England threatened clergy who continued playing Chess with a diet of bread and water.  \r\nThe game has flourished over the years and is now one of the most popular board games in the world, requiring thought, skill and strategy to become successful.\r\n\r\nThe object of Chess is to capture the opponent's King.  To capture the King you must place it in check.

This is absolute madness as the block has been turned into a dead zone jungle. It is time to defend national pride and bring in the big guns. This invasion calls for direct action!\r\n\r\nIt is up to heroic little you to defend the neighbourhood. In this epic turret defence game you are building an army of block defenders with unique skills. You will need to use your fantasy and imagination to conquer the Blockheads once and for all!\r\n\r\nPOWERFUL WEAPONS\r\nLuckily you have some toys to your disposal that can push back the alien invasion.\r\n\r\nBouncer:\r\nBouncers throw tiny bombs that do quite some splash damage. Cheap to build, but has limited range and is best used in large numbers. Summoning bouncers is always a good idea!\r\n\r\nSniper:\r\nShoots enemies from a great distance with a powerful shot. This tower unit has a very wide range and can easily snipe baddies from a far. Unfortunately the sniper does need quite some time to reload itself, but it remains your strongest long range shooter.\r\n\r\nFan:\r\nThe fan unit is not developed to provide a cool breeze in the heat of battle. Instead this fan is very powerful and slows down the approaching army of enemies with a sonic blast. Your other units can then take time and annihilate the competition! Range is quite limited so it is best to place this unit at junctions and close to your other towers.\r\n\r\nTesla turret:\r\nEvery strategy game needs a tesla coil right? This is the most powerful of your units, but also one of the most expensive. It has good range and does a lot of damage. Reload time is relatively quick and it fries enemies with a powerful electrical laser. This is hell-fire of the highest order!\r\n\r\nTurbolaser (from a certain galaxy):\r\nIn later levels you will need this powerful anti air unit as it is the only Block Defender that can shoot flying enemy types. Its X - ray range is limited and you will most likely need a couple of these to counter incoming squadrons. Luckily they are relatively cheap to produce. It can not defend against ground based targets.\r\n\r\nECONOMICS\r\nThese weapons should be sufficient and up to the task. The biggest challenge however, especially in later levels are your economics. You will find that you might need to sell units on the fly in order to purchase new ones. Robots and Blockheads are relentless in their march and it is key to pay attention to where the threat is coming from and what the best counter measures are!\r\n\r\nIn short Block Defender offers a real challenge and with episode unlocks there is always something new just around the corner. And you know what they say - a strategy game a day keeps the brain doctor away!\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\n+ 3 worlds to conquer\r\n+ 30 challenging levels to complete\r\n+ Defend against land, sea and air units \r\n+ 5 powerful units to master (4 ground / 1 air)\r\n+ Many different enemy types to defeat\r\n+ Lite or premium game-play\r\n+ Unique graphical style","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH699JB","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"OffRoad Construction Simulator 3D - Heavy Builders","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63845.13510798886682785.ff4ad3ac-25d2-48ab-95a0-e671d69ac336.e704278a-96fb-4a99-ba2e-83a1f4ea7f97","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58501.13510798886682785.bd96cec1-b8ca-4d7b-b547-367238c96ef4.13068696-6a33-4f35-97ed-5a9312f88afb","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27666.13510798886682785.e117023a-656f-487d-8fbb-09287cb464dd.024217cc-e3c0-4075-a499-0ae1029e5f14","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["14859AppStreamStudios.OffRoadConstructionSimulator_ykgtwtztg31z8"],"ContentIds":["6c1216a8-c47a-42d7-a26b-f7f78ff9d58e","c8c0de1b-057b-c145-a897-aed20d016ae8"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Finally for our construction games & excavator crane fans, we are back with an amazing mountain city construction game on the play store.
