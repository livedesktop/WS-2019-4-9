Starting with Windows 98 other version of solitaire joined the suit - FreeCell, Spider, Tri-Peaks and Pyramid. As a part of the standard Windows installation those games have been popularized around the world. For each of those games millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We combined all six games (Klondike, Spider, FreeCell, Tri-Peaks and two flavors of Pyramid) in a tiny download package. \r\n\r\nThe fun of original games is preserved but some improvement are made to make it easier to play on the small factor devices. In particular, you don't have to drag individual cards - drag&drop whole column, only proper cards will move the rest will snap back. The scoring all the games is simplified to track only number of moves to solve the puzzle. If you stuck, feel free to use hints or undo - implemented by all the games. Use menu (top-tight corner) to change the game type, difficulty, check score, help or to start a new game.\r\n\r\nDon't forget to check our Game section for other fun games...","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4V75V","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Ice Cream Maker - Cooking Game Simulator","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33524.13510798887486267.ffe121ce-cadd-4951-89ad-93c4bd3a4202.22b86b48-e590-47e7-9e25-23fbded02378","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32239.13510798887486267.1ddd175f-2ac5-4341-ba1e-8ea97431468f.b14d8fdf-bdc6-4e40-9ad3-531699c7a7d5","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23847.13510798887486267.ff639279-e548-46dc-bd47-006b890e9b7e.d466c4a0-282b-401e-9500-8d1b0999e264","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18217.13510798887486267.72bc7f21-075f-425c-bb5f-aac3c496a56e.20aee92f-7902-4227-af95-fce555a16510","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32816.13510798887486267.e8d4c62c-fec3-44df-8cc5-6651a2eba585.33481b73-6c3a-48fa-af22-4b9ebb3d73ae","Height":434,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35273.13510798887486267.8628bdec-9b29-43e1-83e2-6df98bbe7058.642cae3a-fcae-4446-8fea-9375fc2fdf03","Height":558,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45821.13510798887486267.9bb3d4f3-b59c-4744-bac1-3a8ac645c530.8670f95b-cfa2-4ff8-ba45-eddcf020582f","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15474.13510798887486267.90617f93-3b80-4fb3-b70f-e1de419742b2.02f0317f-6b75-4513-987e-822da2588608","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45897.13510798887486267.5a70f275-5912-4a49-b8aa-85dad8166254.9af73e60-3431-4acf-aa95-ef50cf7480df","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49173.13510798887486267.eb965b86-f8cb-40e8-a1c9-4b61a4151cb2.02e106ac-65d5-41f5-ac1d-cfa6e1e8e4dd","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["UnitMGames.IceCreamMaker-CookingGameSimulator_tt48tp7szpztr"],"ContentIds":["0ea6c35b-224e-9fdb-9738-a7a888776071","868b9380-8e0f-ff0f-2156-d8cdbfd22985"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"🍦🍨🍦🍨 Here it is folks!

It's a fun twist on a classic board games favorite!\r\n\r\nThe objective of the game is simple: Make as much money as you can, and drive your opponents into bankruptcy. Roll the dice, buy a property, pay rent, pass go, and collect $200. Repeat.\r\n\r\nRoll the dice, travel around the world, trade your property, win auctions, catch the opportunities, create your business: build houses and hotels, charge fees and run the world as a real Businessman.\r\n\r\nBusiness Board is a great game for 2 - 6 players. It is a board game where players roll two six-sided dice to move around the game board, buying and trading properties, and develop them with houses and hotels.

is one of the most played board games in the world, play with your friends, try to defeat your opponents with strategy, reasoning and a little bit of luck.\r\nGeneral rules of dominoes:\r\n- Blocking game\r\nThe most basic dominos variant is for two players and requires a double six set. The 28 domino tiles are shuffled face down and form the stock or boneyard. Each player draws seven tiles; the remainder are not used. Once the players begin drawing tiles, they are typically placed on-edge before the players, so that each player can see his own domino tiles, but none can see the value of other players' tiles. Every player can thus see how many tiles remain in the other players' hands at all times during gameplay. One player begins by downing (playing the first tile) one of their tiles. In different games first tiles are also different. In Muggins player should start with the highest double (6-6), in Bergen the first move should be 0-0, in Mexican train each round starts with the next lower double. This tile starts the line of play, a series of tiles in which adjacent tiles touch with matching, i.e. equal, values. The players alternately extend the line of play with one tile at one of its two ends. The game ends when one player wins by playing their last tile, or when the game is blocked because neither player can play. If that occurs, whoever caused the block gets all of the remaining player points not counting their own.\r\n- Scoring game\r\nPlayers accrue points during game play for certain configurations, moves, or emptying one's hand. Most scoring games use variations of the draw game. In Muggins (All fives) player must make the open ends of the layout add up to 5s or a multiple of five (5s, 10, 15, 20, etc.) In bergen player scores when numbers on the open ends are equal. If a player does not call \"domino\" before the tile is laid on the table, and another player says 'domino' after the tile is laid, the first player must pick up an extra domino. In Mexican train the double zero domino is scored as 50 points.\r\n- Draw game\r\nIn a draw game (blocking or scoring), players are additionally allowed to draw as many tiles as desired from the stock before playing a tile. The score of a game is the number of pips in the losing player's hand plus the number of pips in the stock. Most rules prescribe that two tiles need to remain in the stock. The Draw game is often referred to as simply \"dominos\".\r\n\r\nIf you like board games like Checkers, Mahjong, Backgammon and Chess, you will love Dominoes: Best Classic Dominoes Board Game.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NFNHK48XSPW","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Identity V Zombies Hunter","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4376.13591529474024374.6e9c183e-283d-47bd-8a68-9e5a7bff48b7.3e7e12b3-0b8b-484e-ac6f-991b6847906c","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#1f1f1f","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18534.13591529474024374.6e9c183e-283d-47bd-8a68-9e5a7bff48b7.90cb6b6c-4183-46f3-99d5-a7b3b9512a89","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#1f1f1f","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40013.13591529474024374.adcecf37-0e4f-489d-8557-c0464a989221.be46469a-e9a6-405c-bd2a-caa4314f5ace","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#1f1f1f","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53676.13591529474024374.adcecf37-0e4f-489d-8557-c0464a989221.b666c7ce-0bb9-4940-8a52-1079ec9e977a","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5501.13591529474024374.adcecf37-0e4f-489d-8557-c0464a989221.24846fc6-2249-4e3c-bd52-42c3af831795","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["8533SmartGamesProMX.IdentityVZombiesHunter_5m91jtwxk93h0"],"ContentIds":["5d58dfcc-7adc-fcc2-4a23-a2b62090048b","bc21d3b7-edf4-ac0c-9f5f-7e5b23831700"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"It's a desert island survival Identity V Zombies Hunter.

However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided die, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a six. Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player’s token lands on the same square as your token, then your token will automatically be sent back home and you’ll need to roll a six again.\r\n\r\nPlay LUDO KING, Ludo with Friends NOW for

So, it is pretty simple. If you like Dominoes, then you must definitely play this insanely addictive BEST Domino Game app developed for you! Improve your strategic skills with the BEST Game! \r\n\r\nDominoes is definitely one of the most famous board game in the world. There are dozens of rules out there, but three modes are getting most of the attention:\r\n\r\n- Draw dominoes: simple, relaxing, play your tiles on either side of the board. You only need to match the tile you have with one of the 2 ends already on the board.\r\n\r\nPlaying Dominos game requires, if you want to win most times, of course, a lot of skill and some good luck. So, go ahead and have lots of fun playing this unique game. Your goal is to achieve a certain score to win the game.\r\nIn order to get the pieces (or tiles, or bones) together, the number of pips at the end of each of the tiles must match. It is that simple. Go ahead, look no further. Start playing the best domino game right now. YOU will LOVE it.\r\n\r\n- Block dominoes: basically the same as Draw Dominoes. The main difference is you have to pass your turn if you run out of options (whereas you can pick an extra domino from the boneyard in the previous mode).\r\n\r\n- Dominoes All Five: slightly more complex. Each turn, you need to add all ends of the board, and count the number of pips on them. If it is a multiple of five, you score those points. A bit difficult at first but you will quickly get it!\r\n\r\nBeautiful, simple, relaxing, easy to learn yet complex if you get to learn all the tricks! Will you be a Dominoes master?","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBJ8K0XBBTB","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Drive and Park 3D","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63404.13512276075878327.8a573b36-8e5a-49a6-9aa7-5fab2c299671.2e22ae7b-7fcf-4750-ac6c-c31df980147f","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15344.13512276075878327.8a573b36-8e5a-49a6-9aa7-5fab2c299671.5e9d341d-e5eb-47a5-b3b3-18f686130cf0","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["47061ActionGTAGames.DriveandPark3D_pc1nt5faysgwr"],"ContentIds":["d8ecfc17-126f-ffbd-1308-e7327a8ebf2f"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Drive and Park!
