However, certain entities in the Energy Realm have evolved into matter-less sentient beings. The game’s kitten protagonist (a cat-shaped energy entity) and spirits are all examples of such beings. Pure energy entities can travel freely between the two realms.\r\n\r\nThe story of WENJIA thus unfolds…\r\n\r\nA forest’s longstanding tranquility is shattered by a sudden earthquake. As lava bursts forth from the ground, the mountain’s spirits find themselves surrounded by fiery death. By controlling a kitten, the player must overcome numerous obstacles in the wild to reach the burning heart of the mountain and rescue the spirits before it’s too late.\r\n\r\nCross-Realm Travels\r\n\r\nWENJIA is a 2D platform game with puzzle-solving elements. Players can freely travel between two realms, each of them with different challenges and obstacles. Players must utilize both realms’ mechanisms to reach their final goal.\r\n\r\nSoothing In-game Environment\r\n\r\nWENJIA’s exquisite hand-drawn graphics bring out both the vivid colorfulness of the Matter Realm and the fantastical strangeness of the Energy Realm. The sharp contrast between the two realms offers the players a unique visual feast.\r\n\r\nWorking with game audio talents from Russia, WENJIA’s sound team has created an immersive fantasy environment that features deep woods, eerie ruins, and raging volcanos.\r\n\r\nSimple Gameplay\r\n\r\nWENJIA’s simplified gameplay makes it easy for everyone to enjoy the game.

The simple coloring mode is suitable for the smallest of children, including those of kindergarten and preschool age. These include simple and recognizable images that are easy to color. If the child selects the wrong shape, then they will be prompted with the correct number. Therefore, the picture will always be colored correctly, and the child will quickly memorize the numbers. Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.\r\nSchool-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first to determine what it depicts. Older children can complicate the task by adding addition and subtraction tasks. Now children will need to solve the examples and choose the correct answers in order to color the picture. This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\r\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.\r\nTo make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors. To do this, press and hold the jar of paint and a palette will open. Then you can choose your favorite color. Thus, all the shaded areas of the image can be changed in the coloring by number mode. You can have fun by changing the color scheme to suit your taste.

The King's custom is to spend one night with a woman and execute her in the morning. To avoid this, Sharazad tells him tales of Ali Baba, Aladdin and Sinbad, but leaves part of it unfinished.The King, curious about how the story ends, is thus forced to postpone her execution in order to hear the conclusion. The next night, as soon as she finishes the tale, she begins and only begins a new one, and the King, eager to hear the conclusion, postpones her execution once again until the King finally spares her life. So it goes on for 1,001 nights, The Arabian Nights.\r\n\r\nSOLDIER TURNED WORRIER:\r\nThis is your journey to the past. You are the worrier of the ‘Arabian Nights’.

Carrom is a similar to Billiards or Table Shuffleboard game however instead of pool cues you use your fingers.\r\n\r\nThe object of the game is to flick a striker to hit and pocket a playing coin. The coins can be pocketed into any pocket.\r\n\r\nAs there are a huge number of variations in the rules exists so this App 'tries' to support 2 types of popular Carrom game play i.e. 'Family-Point' and 'Professional' and implements only those Carrom rules which I found practical to implement.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n1. App does not allowed to strike backward from carrom-stricker baseline.\r\n2. Due to scoring rules in 'Professional' game play mode, scoring can only be possible after current round is over.\r\n3. Player sides does not change during the game rather first player breaks first for odd (e.g. 1, 3 ...) number rounds and second player breaks first in even (e.g. 2, 4 ...) number rounds.\r\n4. Max number of rounds for 'Family-Point' game is 5 while 'Professional' mode game is 8. Player can always 'Give up' game during rounds play then game will declares game winner!\r\n5. App provides user to save up to maximum of 9 game plays. \r\n\r\nNote: I have recently released online version of this game app name 'Carrom online', if you are interested to play online please do try that app.\r\n\r\nKindly rate this app that would encourage me to come with new updates and improvements in future. Report your suggestions and issue to my email address mention in App support contact info.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time and looking forward for your feedback & positive

The memories still burn deeply, like spicy chicken wings.\r\n\r\n\"They came without warning, squawking menacingly, their ruffled feathers darkening the sun. Invading intergalactic chickens, out to punish humanity for our oppression of their earthly brethren.\r\n\r\n\"I instantly knew what had to be done. I dropped my half-eaten chicken burger and jumped in my cockpit. With a greasy finger I set my lasers to \"extra crispy\" and blasted off to intercept the fowl invaders.\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't easy. Squawks, feathers flying, the smell of charred chicken everywhere. Three times they invaded, each time with increasingly devious plans. Three times I managed to push them back whence they came, and secure humanity a few more years as the dominant species of this planet.\r\n\r\n\"After their last retreat, I headed for my local Space Burger to bask in the glow of my recent victory. Breathing a sigh of relief, I sat down to enjoy a double chicken-burger with crispy chicken wings on the side.\r\n\r\n\"Little did I know that my greatest adventure was yet to come...\"\r\n\r\n\"Ultimate Omelette\" is the title of the fourth episode in the Chicken Invaders series of casual space shooter games. The game puts players at the forefront of a battle against invading intergalactic chickens, bent on revenge against the human race for our oppression of Earth chickens. In this episode, the chickens have constructed a gigantic cannon capable of launching planet-scale eggs against Earth, with the ultimate goal of encrusting humanity in an impenetrable wall made of egg white. Joined by an unlikely ally, players will travel to foreign, unexplored galaxies in an effort to locate and destroy the egg cannon before it reaches Earth.\r\n\r\nThe enemy repertoire has been significantly broadened, introducing several different kinds of chickens which attack relentlessly in colorful groups and meticulously choreographed formations. The chicken fray is punctuated by fights against boss enemies spanning up to three times the size of the screen. The arsenal at the player's disposal has also been correspondingly extended, with three new weapons and four kinds of supporting satellites providing additional firepower. The player's intergalactic journey is also accentuated by unique fantastic scenarios, such as navigating through a field of gigantic floating feathers, or dodging molten planet chunks during a supernova explosion.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJ9XQ","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Air Assault","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.5746.9007199266251861.d9dbde8d-3cf2-4aed-8263-446e327c881d.89059b04-0935-41db-8d18-5637d785e6fe","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36309.9007199266251861.1c22e4f7-64e5-440a-8c95-63195ef93ef3.a83e064c-184c-48c8-b170-2519c5a53eed","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.18783.9007199266251861.5622ccd1-b5dc-4fd7-8f21-d6d3bf3da822.ca0e9c55-a3e3-47ab-9c69-07abdefc28bf","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["RuiLueSoftware.AirAssault_kxcx7nefnns9a"],"ContentIds":["ebae7842-c143-3fa8-4480-0b0f2d9d2ef5"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Immediately take off, a intense battle has begun!\r\n\r\nEnemy's fighters, artilleries, tanks, warships have been dispatched.\r\nWe prepared three helicopters and many heavy weapons for you, and new helicopters continue to manufacture.\r\nDestroy powerful enemies, across deserts, grasslands, oceans, glaciers, ruins, and usher in the final victory!\r\n\r\n**Support touch, mouse, keyboard**\r\nKeyboard: direction \"↑ ↓ ← → \", weapons \"Z X C\".\r\n\r\nPlease drop your comments, it is really important to us.

In each game the dealer calls two friend cards with the sequence numbers that they appears in the game. The players who play the friend cards with the matching sequence will be the friends of the dealer.\r\n\r\nEach game is played with 6 players and 4 French deck of cards, and each player receives 35 cards at the game start. There is 6 remaining cards in the base.\r\n\r\nIn a game, players pre-bid for trump suites using bid cards. After the trump suite is decided, the dealer claims the 6 base cards and swaps 6 cards from hand back to the base. Then players bid again for trump suite and at the same time claims the base cards and swap 6 cards from hand with the base. \r\n\r\nAfter the bidding process is complete, the dealer calls two friend cards with their appearing sequences. Then the players start to play cards in counter-clock order starting with the dealer for the first round. The winner of each round starts play for the next round. Cards of 5, 10, and K are point cards and the winner of each round takes all the points played in the round. After all cards are played and the two friends are identified, all points of opponent players are added up to get total opponent points. If the friend card appears in the base, whoever last swapped to the base is the friend. The points from the base is multipled by certain factors, which is at least 2 times, and are calculated under the winner of the last round.\r\n\r\nTo determine game results:\r\nTotal opponent points < 160: Dealer side won. For each another 80 points less, the dealer side advances one more level.\r\nTotal opponent points >= 160: Opponent side won. For each another 80 points, the opponent side advances one more level.\r\n\r\nIf the opponent side wins, the next opponent player counter-clockwise from the dealer is the next dealer, with the next game to be played under whatever level he is at.\r\n\r\nThe start player can play any valid pattern (e.g. A, AA, AAA, AAKK, or AAAKKKQQQ), or any combination of patterns as long as no other players reject any pattern of the combos. For example, the start player plays AKK, but another player has a AA pair of the same suite, then the KK pair is rejected and the start player is fined for 20 pt.\r\n\r\nAll pursuant players must first follow with cards that best match the played cards of the start player. If the number of identical cards that the player has is more than the number of identical cards played by the start player, these cards are considered exempt and do not have to follow the best match rule (e.g. the start player plays AA, then the following player do not need to break KKK from hand to best match AA, however he must play KK that is the only pair he has).\r\n\r\nSuite Marks and Bidding Rules\r\nThe suites are of different marks, with diamond the lowest, club the next, then heart, then spade, and then black joker and red joker. However to bid with jokers, you must have at least 3 of the same joker cards.\r\n\r\nGame States\r\n\r\nOpenBid/PreBid/SwapBid\r\nPlayers bid in round-table fashion using bid cards. Bid cards are all jokers plus the level cards of the current dealer.\r\nOpenBid state applies only to the first game, in which all players bid for the dealer seat. The first bidder can bid with one card or any number of cards, and any next bidder must bid with more number of cards than the last bidder, regardless of suite marks.\r\nPreBid state applies to all games except the first, before the dealer claims the base cards, in which all players bid for trump suite. The first bidder can bid with one card or any number of cards, and any next bidder must bid with at least 2, and the same or more number of cards then the last bidder. If bid cards must be of higher marks if the number of cards are the same as the last bidder. \r\nBid state applies to all games including the first, after the dealer claims and buries the base cards, in which all players bid for trump suite AND swap 6 cards with the base.\r\nAny any time in the three bidding states, players must use at least three joker cards to bid.\r\nThe suites are of different marks, with diamond the lowest, club the next, then heart, then spade, and then black joker and red joker. However to bid with jokers, you must have at least 3 of the same joker cards.\r\n\r\nSwapping\r\nEither dealer or the current bidder swaps 6 cards from hand and place them into the base.\r\n\r\nCalling\r\nDealer calls 2 friend cards, with their appearing sequences. The dealer can call any card except trump cards.\r\n\r\nPlaying\r\nAll players dispense cards with the dealer starting in the first round.\r\n\r\nPlayer States:\r\nD: Dealer\r\nF: Friend\r\nO: Opponent\r\nS: Swapped\r\nL: Last swapped (who owns the base cards)\r\n\r\nCard Value\r\nIn each suite, the card denomination decides its value, with Ace being the highest, King the second, then Q, J, 10, and rest of the digits with 2 the lowest. K, 10, 5 are point cards, as K and 10 both represent 10 points and 5 for 5 points.\r\n\r\nTrump suite\r\nThe suite of the last bidder is the trump suite. Jokers and all cards with the same rank as the current level are always considered trump suite cards (hardcore trump cards), which are the only trump suite cards if the trump suite is Joker. The other cards of the same suite as the trump suite are softcore trump cards. The level card of the same suite as the trump suite is of higher value as the level cards of other suites, but all of them are of lower values than the Jokers. All level cards are of the same value if the trump suite is Joker. Red Joker is of the highest value, and black Joker is the second highest. The level cards of suites other than the trump suites are continuous with the highest value softcore trump cards.\r\n\r\nCard Patterns\r\nValid patterns include single card, any number of identical cards of the same rank and color (e.g. 4 cards of Ace Club), or tractors, which are comprised of the same number of cards of continuous ranks (e.g. 2 cards each of Ace and King Heart). However special rules apply to the current level cards, the ranks just over and below the rank of the current level are considered continuous (e.g. if the current level is 4, 5 Club and 3 Club are considered to be continuous). \r\n\r\nPower Combo\r\n4 or more cards of the same rank and suite are power combo that can beat other combo with the same number of total cards (e.g. 3333 beats AAKK or AKKK of the same suite). Such power combo of trump suite can also beats other combo of other non-trump suites.\r\n\r\nTractors\r\nA tractor is the combo of the same number of cards of continuous ranks. E.g. when the current level is 4 Heart, all following are valid tractors: {Red Joker x 2, Black Joker x 2}, {Black Joker x 3, 4 Heart x 3}, {4 Heart x 2, 4 Diamond x 2}, {4 Spade x 4, A Heart x 4}, {Q Heart x 2, J Heart x 2, 10 Heart x 2}, and {5 Heart x 2, 3 Heart x 2}.\r\n\r\nPlay Strategy\r\nDuring each play, the player must assess the current game condition, and side with the strongest players or potential strong players if possible. The goal is to advance to higher levels ahead of everybody else.

However, if you don't have a touchscreen, using a mouse or the keyboard is just as much fun.\r\n\r\nIf solving the mazes at your own pace just isn't challenging enough, tap on Speed Test to see how fast you really are. You will then be able to select the Maze Pack and maze that you would like to solve. Displayed above the maze you will see a timer keeping track of every second it takes you to complete each level. Once completed the game will automatically keep track of your best times. You can always reset the maze and try to beat your record.\r\n\r\nIf you want to increase the difficulty even further, in the settings menu you now have the option to add in your own personal background images from any folder on your computer.\r\n\r\nPlay thousands of mazes for free!
