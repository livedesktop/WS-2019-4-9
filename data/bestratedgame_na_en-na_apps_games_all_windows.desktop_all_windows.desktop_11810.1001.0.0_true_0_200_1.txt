The soldier in this game has a story as well, except that it’s incomplete. The soldier begins to tell the tale, but does not end it.\r\n\r\nThis Game draw parallels to our familiar stories of 'One Thousand And One Nights', The Arabian Nights from the perspective of the soldier. Play this Game and Stretch your mind. Fast forward to the Past for Magic, Romance and History. The more you play, the more you will be amazed. Your victory is to capture all the magic and mystery that are the Arabian Nights.\r\n\r\nTHE STORY WITHIN A STORY:\r\nThe story is of a woman, Sharazad, who marries a King. The King's custom is to spend one night with a woman and execute her in the morning. To avoid this, Sharazad tells him tales of Ali Baba, Aladdin and Sinbad, but leaves part of it unfinished.The King, curious about how the story ends, is thus forced to postpone her execution in order to hear the conclusion. The next night, as soon as she finishes the tale, she begins and only begins a new one, and the King, eager to hear the conclusion, postpones her execution once again until the King finally spares her life. So it goes on for 1,001 nights, The Arabian Nights.\r\n\r\nSOLDIER TURNED WORRIER:\r\nThis is your journey to the past. You are the worrier of the ‘Arabian Nights’. You are a very different sort of Ali Baba, Aladdin and Sinbad. You are the Legend REBORN. You are an iconic figure in the King’s army and you are honored with the Medal of Courage. You are going to be called on to take care of the most nasty situations. The King realized that assault from the sea was always a commando like operation which required special training, bold leadership, and an aggressive spirit. You have gained a lot of the valuable combat experience in Arabian battles. You take on this legendary character of the soldier that turned into a worrier and have to finish the story. You can turn around the remaining story whenever you want.\r\n\r\nACTION PLAY:\r\n- This is a 6-Axis controls game in Full HD and 3D Graphics.\r\n- Your Weapon is the \"Six Pack\" Automatic Machine
