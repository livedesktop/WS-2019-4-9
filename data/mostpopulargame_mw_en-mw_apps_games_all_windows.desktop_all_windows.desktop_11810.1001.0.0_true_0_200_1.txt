Board pieces move based on dice throws.\r\n\r\nThis is a game of skill. A single game can be decided by luck, but the more one plays, the more the skill is important. After ~30 games the true skill emerges. Even a beginner can beat an expert through luck of draw in a single game, but after several games the skill prevails.\r\n\r\nThis version of Backgammon uses an advanced neural network in the highest levels, and will challenge advanced players. It also offers a fun experience for beginners, with lower difficulty levels and showing possible moves.\r\n\r\nThe scoring is based on the official Backgammon ELO system, with each game increasing or reducing rating points every game or match.\r\n\r\nFEATURES:\r\n=========\r\n* Worldwide online high scores\r\n* Play a Trial Game, or a Scored Game that counts towards your score\r\n* High res graphic board\r\n* Dice statistics history\r\n* Real time probability calculation\r\n* Achievements\r\n* Tutorials\r\n* 4 difficulty levels: easy to hard\r\n* 1 or 2 player mode\r\n* Many options:\r\n    - Money or Match play style\r\n    - Doubling cube\r\n    - Sound on/off\r\n    - Show possible moves\r\n    - Animation speed\r\n    - Auto-throw-dice\r\n    - Strict tournament rules\r\n    - Dice randomness \r\n    - Show PIP and point numbers\r\n    - Try different moves, then ‘accept’ or ‘undo’\r\n    - Beaver rule\r\n* Auto-save: don’t lose games in progress\r\n* Always fun: the phone plays differently every time\r\n\r\nAlso available on Windows Phone, Windows 8 and Windows 10.\r\n\r\nIn Windows Phone, 'Backgammon Pro+' paid version has no Ads\r\n\r\nVERSION HISTORY\r\n===============\r\nv1.99 - Ad option to remove ads for free, UI improvements, keyboard shortcuts (ESC=back, U=Undo), save to roaming storage to preserve all settings and statistics even when reinstalling\r\nv1.15 - optimized for WP8, fast app resume, larger screens, higher resolution icon\r\nv1.14- faster dice rotation when there is a cube\r\nv1.13- new Mercenne Twister random algorithm, faster dice rotation when possible, do not throw dice if bar is full\r\nv2.11-2.12 - bug fixes, UI fixes","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDLZ0N","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Spider (Free)","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31670.9007199266438783.608d1e9f-946a-475c-8fa3-fb013108b76f.d1a00048-bf4e-4380-b822-47b4f734b416","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12759.9007199266438783.76a8d8d5-0839-40d7-afb8-c18936974284.c1e10216-8b84-4a70-a801-e9c6f03ab92a","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["GASPMobileGamesInc.SpiderFree_9haz0p453120e"],"ContentIds":["36c317a0-65c4-4f2d-0019-1053e835a3a3","9316fd81-8525-e96a-d197-14cf6648a3fd"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"The most popular version of Spider Solitaire was introduced in Windows 98. The aim of the game is to get all of the cards in order (King to Ace). To win, you must remove all the cards from the table by building columns organized in descending order, from king to ace. At intermediate (2-suits) and advanced (4-suites) levels, the cards must also match suit. When you succeed in building a sequentially-ordered column, it flies off the table. If you run out of moves, click the pile at the bottom of the table to deal a new row of cards. \r\n\r\nIn our version we largely tried to recreate a full experience of that version in a tiny download package, along with multiple suite versions of the game, hints and undo (top right corner of the title bar). But there are also some minor twists to make it easier to play on a small factor mobile devices. In particular you don't have to select a card to move - drag and drop entire column - only appropriate cards will move, the rest will snap back. The scoring is also changed - only number of moves counted - the lower the score - the better.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDC3H3","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Chess Riddles Deluxe","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39369.9007199266355838.d5978be6-8d6f-4ca0-b234-267ed3cb6606.8d4dde73-e708-474f-a413-59ead3e368dd","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57187.9007199266355838.da5af03e-aafc-46e5-a497-d36e143c59cb.10e91416-204f-4715-9375-cc0fb5e33425","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["19506NektariosGiannoulis.ChessRiddlesDeluxe_8nyed6ycj0kqg"],"ContentIds":["90aad5ef-70e0-f048-ca64-d74ef376401a","48d87b1e-2b0d-e010-5913-264ef0035366"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Can you place eight chess queens on an 8×8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other?

Apparently AI is suddenly all the rage however the 2019 edition celebrates 16 years of ZingMagic bringing you the best in AI based board, card and puzzle games. So, yep we mastered AI along time ago!\r\n\r\nRegardless of your playing level, ZingMagic's multi award winning Chess is a fun, stimulating and challenging game for beginners and champions alike.\r\n\r\nChess is a two player game with a colourful history which can be traced back to its Indian ancestor, Chaturanga. In 1291 the Archbishop of Canterbury in England threatened clergy who continued playing Chess with a diet of bread and water.  \r\nThe game has flourished over the years and is now one of the most popular board games in the world, requiring thought, skill and strategy to become successful.\r\n\r\nThe object of Chess is to capture the opponent's King.  To capture the King you must place it in check.  If the King cannot escape by itself, or with the help of its army, it is in checkmate and the King is captured.\r\n \r\nZingMagic’s multi award winning Chess application supports over 20 levels of play allowing you to play moves or games against the clock or relax and play at your own pace. Whatever level of Chess you choose, you can be sure that ZingMagic’s Chess will give you a fun, stimulating and challenging game.\r\n\r\nThis game is ad-funded.

It's for babies, toddlers, or anyone who benefits from learning about shapes, patterns, matching, and early motor skills.  The default mode is to connect two shapes by tapping one and then the matching one. When two shapes are connected, a light tone is played, and when all the shapes on the screen are connected, a fun WIN sound is played. Ads are included to keep the game free, and for a small fee they can be removed... but if you like the game, it would be great if you could click an ad every now and then.\r\n\r\nSettings are accessed through the Windows 8 Settings interface, making it less likely for your little one to need to ask you for help if they get into it.  You can set up the game to:\r\n\r\n* Tap, drag a line, or draw a line to connect shapes. Tapping works great for children under 2 years old.\r\n\r\n* Match either 2, 3, 4, or a random number (between 2, 3, and 4) of shapes on the screen.\r\n\r\n* Choose between connecting 2-dimensional shapes, 3-dimensional shapes, or 3-dimensional outlines.\r\n\r\n* Race - Play 5 games with the current settings.

Blackjack is a comparing card game between a player and dealer and played with one or more French decks of 52 cards.\r\nThe player is dealt an initial two card hand with the option of drawing cards to bring the total value to 21 or less without exceeding it, so that the dealer will lose by having a lesser hand than the player or by exceeding 21. Since the 1960s, blackjack has been a high profile target of advantage players, particularly card counters, who track the profile of cards yet to be dealt, and adapt their wager and playing strategy accordingly. While in our implementation we do not teach counting, we do offer basic strategy hints to train you on how to improve your odds.\r\nMany rule variations of BlackJack exist. Our implementation offers most common casino rules:\r\n- Play with 4 decks\r\n- Decks are reshuffled when there is less than 20 cards left.\r\n- Dealer stands on soft 17\r\n- Player can split twice\r\n- Neither surrender nor insurance are offered\r\nWhen hints are enabled, player would need to confirm his choice if it's not the most optimum action.\r\nWhen you running short on credits, feel free to use our build in slot machine - truly the loosest slots in town!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9MT23KFCDF5W","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Block Puzzle - Wood Legend","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4676.13821246868328114.606d4caf-0e20-441c-b6a7-2536a922b5eb.28496991-dbb1-48a4-bc93-47ae440ecf52","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.11297.13821246868328114.606d4caf-0e20-441c-b6a7-2536a922b5eb.dc73ddc8-5159-4e56-9afc-5b8ee6802ab9","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35454.13821246868328114.a01ceba0-6124-4a86-aebd-3e1d2baf5b3b.da7aa727-9685-449e-b428-6798e7862c41","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["61957Casualgame.ClassicWoodBlockPuzzle_0nt7ynh0rqkt4"],"ContentIds":["bac914dc-967e-0aad-dbd3-cfeaa8e34f7d"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Block Puzzle - Wood Legend is a addictive and classic puzzle game!\r\n\r\nChallenge yourself and play the best mind game with building blocks.

This game is quite addictive, that's for sure because it is very popular. If you loved Peggle Montezuma, marble woka woka Zuma Deluxe or Zumas Temple Quest. It's about our version of the famous Zuma. For the once that are wondering what kind of game is Zuma, here is little explanation. You will see many colorful balls in the game and the scope of the game is actually very simple - you must join 3 balls with same color on the chain and destroy them. So it sounds very easy and yes, it is but not that easy because it asks for some strategic thinking in order to complete this task.\r\n\r\nAlso you get a chance to choose your playing mode. When you are still a beginner, choose the 'easy mode' but as you become more skilled, the 'hard mode' would be your bigger challenge.\r\n\r\nThe game consists of three levels, three different worlds that hide their own challenges. The first world is 'Amazon jungle', the second one is 'Ancient Ruins' while the third one takes you to the \"Frozen Land\". You start joining the balls and if you don't manage to pass the level, you get a chance to play the level once again. Actually if you are not satisfied by our score in general, you could play again each level you want. Now let's see how is this going in praxis.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJ2TK","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Dragon's Blade II FX","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39149.9007199266245968.f305124d-e43a-411d-b6ce-f02a471ede41.215d7cb3-cb31-4d87-bcd5-f5fafc0bd75e","Height":200,"Width":200,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33387.9007199266245968.04fe92e0-a46e-4af4-bc6a-e6ba7eec1151.2fbc7bdf-5091-4b20-9f7a-8aee9fd7e1c3","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44215.9007199266245968.186927ed-ac5b-4642-a250-542a868397f7.e9519f55-7df6-442c-886d-d4036f6bd959","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10408.9007199266245968.38c43961-39d7-4020-9a30-1773deddab19.c0e995c2-c100-4612-8a4b-3b3728362fa8","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62224.9007199266245968.e1f6f77f-a333-4ffe-83a4-aef8b001fe8d.d2b20e09-0a74-4a1d-a8de-2980c692d995","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24165.9007199266245968.8d0e0e7d-2bff-4211-a85e-7666c8e4290d.e3815a0c-30b5-4842-bf24-b2ea301a862d","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["NateMonsterLLC.DragonsBladeIIFX_1v1304hp7jwzg"],"ContentIds":["e87370ff-38f5-0c52-08d1-7beec2d6d86c","524f8c9a-f13c-0791-874b-096a82b6ec73","b1678219-f670-2eaa-3a4d-91102ac77e11","096b2331-a554-9e9c-ee20-20ba4976adcd","66a863e1-297c-6e20-fdf2-595322fa90a0"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Return to the golden age of turn-based RPG gaming in this instant classic, exclusively for Windows.

The Tetris game was created by Alexey Pajitnov in 1984—the product of Alexey’s computer programming experience and his love of puzzles. In the decades to follow, Tetris became one of the most successful and recognizable  games, appearing on nearly every gaming platform available. This App is based on the classic Tetris, a new development in windows10!\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE\r\n\r\nThe goal of Tetris is to score as many points as possible by clearing horizontal lines of Blocks. The player must rotate, move, and drop the falling Tetriminos inside the Matrix (playing field). Lines are cleared when they are filled with Blocks and have no empty spaces.\r\n\r\nAs lines are cleared, the level increases and Tetriminos fall faster, making the game progressively more challenging. If the Blocks land above the top of the playing field, the game is over.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N61743SS1QK","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Words Classic Solo","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22541.14027833879453294.75ac5ae4-18d9-4ab4-b0d8-3048f8373ab0.909964c9-fc62-41cc-919e-e9a394a6a416","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64303.14027833879453294.75ac5ae4-18d9-4ab4-b0d8-3048f8373ab0.712079fc-7aa2-42ae-9760-c5ab4c3680c1","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22541.14027833879453294.75ac5ae4-18d9-4ab4-b0d8-3048f8373ab0.909964c9-fc62-41cc-919e-e9a394a6a416","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["51268InstantBestFriendsGa.WordFriendsScrabble_ccmdd2pm9wmtt"],"ContentIds":["68e43956-0649-8fdf-65be-c21445b9b47b","2836bfc9-17b1-8386-086d-5c6e8152a934"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Create words in the English dictionary to score points.

It is played on a square board, made of 64 smaller squares, with eight squares on each side. Each player starts with sixteen pieces: eight pawns, two knights, two bishops, two rooks, one queen and one king. The goal of the game is for each player to try and checkmate the king of the opponent. Checkmate is a threat ('check') to the opposing king which no move can stop. It ends the game.\r\nDuring the game the two opponents take turns to move one of their pieces to a different square of the board. One player ('White') has pieces of a light color; the other player ('Black') has pieces of a dark color. There are rules about how pieces move, and about taking the opponent's pieces off the board. The player with white pieces always makes the first move. Because of this, White has a small advantage, and wins more often than Black in tournament games.\r\nDeveloping Chess strategy and improving your Chess skill!

Starting with Windows 98 other version of solitaire joined the suit - FreeCell, Spider, Tri-Peaks and Pyramid. As a part of the standard Windows installation those games have been popularized around the world. For each of those games millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We combined all six games (Klondike, Spider, FreeCell, Tri-Peaks and two flavors of Pyramid) in a tiny download package. \r\n\r\nThe fun of original games is preserved but some improvement are made to make it easier to play on the small factor devices. In particular, you don't have to drag individual cards - drag&drop whole column, only proper cards will move the rest will snap back. The scoring all the games is simplified to track only number of moves to solve the puzzle. If you stuck, feel free to use hints or undo - implemented by all the games. Use menu (top-tight corner) to change the game type, difficulty, check score, help or to start a new game.\r\n\r\nDon't forget to check our Game section for other fun games...","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDN9BV","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Klondike Solitaire Collection Free","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44123.9007199266467213.16f966bd-91b3-499d-b5d0-624670f995ee.4f95761d-3b5d-4ccf-a1ca-a9e78f8f7fc1","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#1A9056","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15536.9007199266467213.2e5fe63e-6a57-454d-9bf2-3b777360a886.edff3f0c-fe47-4fef-8db7-6da479bd9707","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#1A9056","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27720.9007199266467213.b83937e7-abfc-4976-8af1-6167f0b59caf.db342d0a-df4a-4d35-8c82-16fd573163b9","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#1A9056","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20751.9007199266467213.f7770934-d3ef-4bed-8758-ae8afac05c85.5a6ca0fa-c92d-4bb7-93cf-c75bb973fa25","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#1A9056","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10097.9007199266467213.53e68378-de60-4404-89be-b527f305002b.1370432f-f205-452f-994f-b734c7ba9cf2","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#1A9056","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48652.9007199266467213.1fff2ed9-a145-40c7-8898-2d2bdb0d7505.3296d161-e06f-43d9-8352-7dda1d8ef064","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#1A9056","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13661.9007199266467213.45376708-4b7a-4358-b0d2-aa676a2716ac.21b99ca1-adae-45a8-959c-4394b10e6bdd","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#1A9056","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64312.9007199266467213.5d7fa4f2-0c04-4471-8934-5ef3c490f3b0.7151fb2f-f473-4cea-acfc-9825177f7560","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57286.9007199266467213.281bf202-7f92-4065-9a6d-3e7f85664107.8526cbd3-0637-4572-8ed4-e7c1101e7a86","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#1A9056","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["TreeCardGames.KlondikeSolitaireCollectionFree_n666hb6ddc5jp"],"ContentIds":["54bd1739-9aa6-2aaa-2ef6-15c26015f944","6c2c51cd-beb9-f99c-f079-ca93c913bc21","11a1a2ba-9394-70ab-8106-b034a3a77ccc"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Play a free beautiful collection of Klondike solitaire game variations, including:\r\n- Klondike\r\n- Klondike by Threes\r\n- Klondike Two Decks\r\n- Easthaven\r\n\r\nWe support our apps and your feedback is welcome.
