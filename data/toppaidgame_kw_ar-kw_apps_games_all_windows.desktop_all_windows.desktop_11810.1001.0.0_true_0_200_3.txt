Regardless of the number of correct answers given, and of stars earned, the child’s developing skills will be fostered by enthusiastic applause and floating balloons!\r\n\r\nThe educational flashcards for kids are divided into the following categories: “Cars and Transport”, “Professions”, “Buildings”, “Musical Instruments”, “Tools”, “Furniture”, “Kitchen Tools” and “Clothing and shoes”. \r\n\r\nOne important distinction makes this educational app stand out from the rest: instead of drawings, which are not always easy to identify as a real object, the child will see bright, beautiful and fun-spirited photographs. This will allow the child to “see” each object as it actually appears in the real world, while allowing the parent to tell the child more about this object.\r\n\r\nDoes the youngster have an older brother or sister in grade school? They can also use this educational game! In addition to English, this app also supports the Spanish, German and many other languages. \r\n\r\nWhile playing with the educational flashcards in a foreign language, a school-age child can effortlessly learn many new words with which to surprise their teachers and classmates. An A+ is guaranteed!\r\n\r\nThe youngster does not need to be able to read in order to use this educational app. The simple interface and spoken clues allow even the youngest of children to play and learn independently. \r\n\r\nExperience has shown that children love to look through a series of colorful pictures with sounds, and they will ask to see them again and again. According to Glenn Doman, an American physical therapist and the founder of The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential, participating in these kinds of educational activities (for 5-10 minutes a day) stimulates the development of various regions in the brain. As a result, the child's photographic memory takes shape, the child develops much faster than his or her peers, and, beginning at infancy, the child gains access to a world of encyclopedic knowledge. \r\n\r\nThe main point, in which Doman is undoubtedly correct, is that the younger a child, the more easily he or she can absorb new knowledge. It's important to make use of this ability while it's available!\r\n\r\nThe app can be used as a supplementary teaching aid in foreign language instruction. Supported languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Russian, Polish, Ukrainian.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFHWFK","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Skulls of the Shogun","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.5136.9007199266246748.e6cb85f0-8e67-402f-8019-90e10faedb40.1d23d216-dd78-416d-85d1-a0ca6b022caf","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#222222","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.60007.9007199266246748.ae96f67f-62ad-4f17-9ccd-03c9c388f72a.a4eb0af0-d224-414e-b966-089a97388d38","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#222222","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"‪د.ك.‏‎ 1.500‬","Price":1.5,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"2","PackageFamilyNames":["Microsoft.SkullsOfTheShogun_8wekyb3d8bbwe"],"ContentIds":["6e05513c-cc4e-4b27-d910-a3dc1fc1eefc","60a90895-ee7b-f8d2-d6f2-886bf2c137db"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"كمبيوتر شخصي,جوال","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Washing up on the shores of the afterlife, players meet and join forces with vibrant ghost-samurai warriors, magical animal-monks, and mustachioed samurai generals on the way to capture Skulls of the Shogun.

Play with your friends from Facebook or with random rivals in the network!\r\n\r\nAre you a curling fan? Then try this Ultra-Realistic, 3D, Curling Simulation Game.\r\nYou’re not a curling fan? Try Curling3D anyway and you’ll fall in love with curling and our game.\r\n\r\nCurling3D is one of the best curling simulation games for one or two players. Similar to shuffleboard, the game is played on a flat ice curling sheet, roughly 15x150 feet. Players slide round stones of about 40 pounds towards bull's eye targets at either end. Two teammates may use brooms to sweep the ice in front of the moving stone. Curling3D is a follow-up to MaxNick's successful iCurling game, and adds a new dimension of realism with 3D rendering and on-screen players. Many user suggestions have been integrated into this new curling simulation.\r\n\r\nCurling3D attempts to simulate the excitement of the game by incorporating many aspects of the actual sport. Fundamentally, curling is about force, mass, friction, momentum, rotation and collision. The app exploits the sophisticated physics engine built into the iPhone OS to generate a convincing simulation of all these elements as they interact. In the terminology of curling, the weight is the velocity of the stone; the turn is the rotation of the stone (which affects its trajectory); and the line is the direction of the throw or delivery. Curling3D allows the player to continuously and independently control all three, permitting advanced tactics such as the guard, takeout, and tap. In addition, the app allows the player to sweep the ice while their stone is moving, adjusting trajectory after the delivery.\r\n\r\nTry it… you won’t be disappointed.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGGZHK1C","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Little Mole's Find It","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18134.13510798883287522.02f739bf-d71a-4f96-b3c2-7ab37fc3071f.403271bd-d0e0-45dc-83f5-4084a40e8594","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44970.13510798883287522.77961990-8f4f-48e3-b000-7801741159dc.a05c9a17-676a-4993-b930-9385cac39654","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"‪د.ك.‏‎ 0.900‬","Price":0.9,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["SiliconJelly.LittleMolesFindIt_6v809z49xp5gp"],"ContentIds":["94f6a8bc-4aad-9ada-9c1b-95d614516510","be8ef4ec-211c-0bb1-4972-43fb9a879769"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"كمبيوتر شخصي,جوال","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"If you love the Little Mole, you need this game!

Wield magic cards instead of weapons and slay the armies of darkness in the dungeons below the Old Cathedral. Save the terror-stricken Paperverse from the clutches of the Archdemon himself! \r\n\r\nCARDS AND DECKBUILDING\r\nIt’s not a card game, but items, spells, and skills are all expressed as cards. The strategy lies in adapting your hand to each situation. Cards can be upgraded with runes and you can find many variants with diverse bonuses. Legendaries are the most epic but hard to acquire.\r\n\r\nTAILORED SESSIONS WITH FLEXISCOPE\r\nBook of Demons respects your time. It features the Flexiscope engine which allows you to divide the game into sessions of any size. It even learns your pace of gaming and predicts the time to complete the next session.\r\n\r\nUNIQUE MECHANICS\r\nSimplified movement and fight mechanics is where Book of Demons differs the most from other hack & slash games. There is often not enough time to click-remove all of the obstacles such as monster shields, enemy spells, poison, or knocked cards, so timing, card selection and order of execution are critical.\r\n\r\nHACK & SLASH IN THE WORLD OF PAPERVERSE\r\nBook of Demons takes place in Paperverse, a world that exists entirely inside a pop-up book. It’s a tale of good and evil about saving the world from the ultimate devilry. Sounds familiar? Inspired by the dark and gloomy atmosphere of the first Diablo game, Book of Demons is part tribute part parody of hack & slash classics.\r\n\r\nCOMFORT OF GAMEPLAY\r\nMany Book of Demons features were designed with gameplay comfort in mind. Points of interest are marked at the top of the screen and get revealed once you get closer. Your character leaves footprints, which can be used to track your way back or notice paths already visited without opening the map.\r\n\r\nCHALLENGING ENDGAME\r\nOn average it takes about 10 hours to complete the campaign with a single class, but maxing out a character and mastering all of the higher Freeplay difficulty levels and Quests takes much longer. The Roguelike mode offers another level of challenge with permadeath, restricted healing and even more obstacles to overcome.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4VFQK","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"MineChat: Universal Edition","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49818.13510798887499790.efcb12a2-dd08-4b6b-b733-62ac66a465b8.129f6de0-9828-439c-a9f5-3f6f6e981f09","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46797.13510798887499790.8602887c-ad0d-44ef-a319-df1c9015a53f.85fcd5d7-5732-4ed5-b740-aab8a058c8f8","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5658.13510798887499790.4143344e-b3b0-47e6-bf4b-27b16e50b95a.1be8364c-58b5-4265-84cd-1d1a654de0ca","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17713.13510798887499790.397bcd4c-fde9-40ff-8d29-54c085855aeb.01b94033-d6d0-45bf-a10f-131a02708cc8","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47872.13510798887499790.e33fb70e-e7a6-4484-b029-8e2d797c009c.206b0003-1bc3-4b7f-a153-d772c5697449","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.528.13510798887499790.418cef07-c633-4b23-ab2d-afef3101c191.4621366e-51ca-4750-b214-df99eca1f9ce","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"‪د.ك.‏‎ 0.900‬","Price":0.9,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["KellyProductions.MineChatWindows10Edition_72h1nsemd1psy"],"ContentIds":["05c54f23-c8d8-322c-b036-fa3fceb82c66","90ec5bd5-76fa-e8a6-a50c-acf516bb9f77"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"كمبيوتر شخصي,جوال","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Connect to online Minecraft servers on your mobile device.

Notes: - MineChat does not work with servers that require client modification such as Tekkit. - MineChat will work over 3G/4G, but eats up a good bit of data and can run slow depending on your connection. So it is recommended you are on WI-fi when in using MineChat. - MineChat does not support Forge Modloader servers. - MineChat sends a spawn command automatically upon connection to help prevent your character from getting killed while using the app. However, not all servers support the spawn command or have delay before teleporting you which leaves your character vulnerable during that time period. Be sure you are aware how your server handles spawning. Security: MineChat does not send any credentials or information of any kind to any third party servers. The only information transmitted is directly to Minecraft servers. It uses the exact same login method as the Minecraft game uses. It transmits login credentials over SSL and uses encryption while transmitting game data. For additional information or issues when connecting, please contact us directly as we cannot respond to Windows Store reviews.\r\n\r\nMineChat does not support modded clients such as Forge and Tekkit.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4XBSN","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Five Nights at Granny's Revelations","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25610.13510798887543659.1dd80de7-61b8-4616-84f9-d3655b72016e.654dd5fb-524b-4cba-854d-171baf77539b","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59479.13510798887543659.07027c59-6bf4-463d-b1a2-c8c6b99b4a69.508e2162-44b8-49b5-a8f4-7e3a262b1e03","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10909.13510798887543659.083884a9-dcef-4483-bbec-09a6575d9368.58fddd9d-2e22-41ad-9a6c-dcc5075dfe2a","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47781.13510798887543659.81f0690a-5b53-42ea-9821-dba8acf70ef0.f3a60ba1-6c3c-4859-b69b-2f0db5a9302c","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47019.13510798887543659.94ea9f56-dfc9-43d9-9bd0-8ec7c073bb53.4b5bb794-6f45-41d8-b751-df2da6e69a13","Height":434,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4095.13510798887543659.d77092de-03d3-443d-ac1e-f9b9a43cf771.2f5b5495-a3a9-4045-8340-697e71fdfffa","Height":558,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3551.13510798887543659.9ea3bec8-a5ed-47d3-ac8d-0f3374b4fb17.79f7656d-e0f9-403b-a3be-58aad14ab76f","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14385.13510798887543659.f9df5963-1fa2-4433-865a-73b025f273eb.0054d7d6-dcfd-4c97-8067-054874e919f0","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37084.13510798887543659.e1ef0e69-5656-4f85-8eae-1d29765eccd4.e51985ef-9e9d-43cc-84e9-ac1ccc92c45c","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"‪د.ك.‏‎ 0.600‬","Price":0.6,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["45679ZealousDreams.FiveNightsatGrannysRevelations_6209jy6j60fh4"],"ContentIds":["65472948-a135-65ff-cbd8-9fad8efac9ee"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"كمبيوتر شخصي","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"New Five Nights is here with a completely new style and design making FNAG the best in the market.

With an endless gameplay, Floaties will keep you hooked as you travel 8 different worlds filled with specific obstacles. All you have to do is tap to keep the characters floating, but the easy controls are balanced by an almost impossible gameplay. Dare to take this challenge?\r\n\r\nMain Features:\r\n✔ Endless Floating Gameplay. Control up to 4 “floaties” at the same time each with its own color by simply tapping to help them float. Each floatie is immune to the same color obstacles but is destroyed instantly by obstacles with other colors. Your main goal is to have a fleet of all colors and to try surviving the longest. Easy to play, but impossible to survive for long!\r\n\r\n✔ 8 Adventurous Worlds. Help your floaties survive through the ancient world of Egypt, the sci-fi landscape of the Moon, the unlawful Wild Wild West, the dangerous Jurassic Park and more. Each of the 8 playable worlds feature its own particularities depicted in eye-catching 3D graphics so get ready to dodge out-of-orbit satellites on the Moon, T-Rex bones in Jurassic Park and hundreds others!\r\n\r\n✔ Dozens of Characters. From flying drones, chicken, rockets to E.T., Cleopatra or even Jack the pirate you can unlock more than 40 different fun characters. Collect coins throughout the game and use those to spin the wheel of fortune to get a new random character or unlock your favorite one. Gain experience with each character and level them up to 5 stars!\r\n\r\n✔ Powerups and abilities. Aside coins you can collect special objects that help you gain powerups for a limited time (i.e. collect 4 potion bottles to double your coin collection for 15 seconds). With your new abilities you’ll survive longer and score higher. \r\n\r\n✔ Solve Quests. Each world has a theoretically endless flying/floating gameplay, although in reality you die A LOT, but offers side quests too. Can you collect 7 items of the same color? Or have one of RGBY floatie destroyed a couple of times? The more quests you solve, the tougher that level gets. You start at Easy, advance to Medium and become a master when you reach the Hard level of difficulty.\r\n\r\n✔ Achievements & Leaderboards. Connect via Google Play Services to unlock more achievements and access the social or global leaderboards if your score is high enough. You’ll also be able to analyze the statistics for each world, such as how many items you’ve collected, how many quests you’ve completed, what was the best score and MUCH MORE!\r\n\r\n✔ Multiplayer Challenges. Provoke up to 4 of your friends to a game of keeping floating characters alive! You can play the game in multiplayer mode and this gives 4 users the chance to play Floaties on the same device. Who can be the best? Only practice will tell!\r\n\r\nAside surviving all sorts of entrapments that destroy Floaties of a different color (i.e. than the obstacle color) you must collect coins, power-ups and character resurrection items. Play often and you will be able to get free coins too by pulling the handle of a slot machine. The same game will unlock a random character for 100 coins.\r\n\r\nEach world you play in features awesome 3D graphics and well designed characters that create a great gaming experience especially accompanied by an entertaining soundtrack and sounds.\r\n\r\nTHANK YOU for downloading, playing and rating Floaties!

Your character had inherited a curious trinket from his grandfather: a massive key with a label - an address was written on it. The heir had arrived to the specified location and surprisingly discovered a huge empty hangar right in front of him. Inside, in the corner of the hangar, there was a computer desk, and software for managing the cryptocurrency farm was carefully installed on the computer! So, as you can see, your character's grandfather didn't left any fortune - instead, he left a tool for making this fortune. He knew his grandson would be smart, that's for sure.\r\nHaving evaluated the situation, you begin to manage things. Your plan is to buy and install video card racks, provide them with energy and cooling, generate cryptocurrency and exchange it at the best rate. And your highest goal is to make your farm as large as possible!\r\n\r\nKey features:\r\n- More than a dozen different types of equipment with a variety of characteristics;\r\n- Tactical depth - the efficiency of the farm directly depends on how you install and arrange all the equipment;\r\n- Cryptocurrency exchange rate that changes dynamically, being represented within a clear graph;\r\n- System administrators and brokers who will help you automate farm management - they can replace the old equipment and automatically exchange the cryptocurrency.\r\n\r\nWe remind you that this is a game, and the bitcoin generation doesn't happen for real. Also, the in-game bitcoin exchange rate may not correspond to the real one. However, the game experience can encourage you to try some cryptocurrency mining activity in the real life, so it's up to you!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NNQ0XVQWLJG","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Slay","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5129.13738559929070233.c68058ef-cd3b-42c6-a328-3c081b50d078.947418fb-2ae9-4277-8ab9-12baf1176d0a","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4938.13738559929070233.c68058ef-cd3b-42c6-a328-3c081b50d078.b1a24ae7-f061-4817-80ca-fce39e080c7b","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40170.13738559929070233.c68058ef-cd3b-42c6-a328-3c081b50d078.efe63312-d29c-4eac-ace1-ee768f0b103a","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36171.13738559929070233.c68058ef-cd3b-42c6-a328-3c081b50d078.43345925-f05d-4fad-bc9b-121eb695cfca","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3366.13738559929070233.f2acd43a-db37-4931-9519-063a59adcbbd.46967e4f-95b6-4bf8-adeb-5083e53a95ec","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56204.13738559929070233.f2acd43a-db37-4931-9519-063a59adcbbd.bffbedc0-2d83-4b31-b892-5f7200edb80e","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9064.13738559929070233.c68058ef-cd3b-42c6-a328-3c081b50d078.a3794bf7-72e0-4397-83a5-cfeaa6b89ba9","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44878.13738559929070233.c68058ef-cd3b-42c6-a328-3c081b50d078.316d5cd6-2231-44d0-8de8-f95df78a35cf","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45536.13738559929070233.c68058ef-cd3b-42c6-a328-3c081b50d078.de9175c4-60fc-4121-b1ca-324c1d487e53","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"‪د.ك.‏‎ 3.000‬","Price":3.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["SeanOConnor.Slay_xsxeny04hkh40"],"ContentIds":["20decc0d-84ab-4992-167d-534cefbd637f"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"كمبيوتر شخصي","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Slay is a turn based strategy game where your goal is to conquer the island by buying men and using them to capture your enemies' hexagons.

Their first book of fairytales that was published back in 1812 included about 200 fairy tales making those brothers one of the most famous storytellers of folk tales, which made stories like 'Cinderella', 'The Frog Prince', 'Hansel and Gretel', 'Rapunzel', Sleeping Beauty' and 'Snow White' to be well-known all around the world. Even though it is known that those tales are collected, there are numerous discussions about the ideology behind those tales sometimes being criticized for the certain note of violence and crudity that appears in some of the stories while others debate about the possibility of including real situations when the brothers were editing those stories.\r\n\r\nDoris and Ralph are philologists that work in one of the most interesting clubs in the world. They have job as many of us would dream of. Namely this time they got a task to discover if the brothers Grimm's fairytales are based on true stories or they are simply part of someone's fantasy, no matter if brothers Grimm's or the fantasy of the folk storyteller, taken in general.\r\n\r\nDoris and Ralph are at the moment in the land where they hope that was the land where actually happened the story about Snow White and the seven dwarfs.

It is about missing persons, or let's be more precise, it's about a missing child, a child that has been actually kidnapped. Missing persons are always vulnerable subject but when it is about a missing child, the pressure is even bigger.\r\n\r\nThis case got a huge publicity and attention in the media. The journalists are literally following every Albert's step, being curious to find out where the child is and who is responsible for his kidnapping. Following the available traces, Albert gets to the parking place where the child was seen for the last time. On this place the missing child was transferred from one vehicle to another. Actually this is the last stop, from the investigation. From now on, every trace is lost.\r\n\r\nNow it seems that Albert has a whole new case in front of him. It seems as he is starting from zero, and anything could help him move on in dealing the case. That means that the best detective will definitely need some help from you. Work together on the case because that way you could help him see things that he might overlook at first.

This girl has a very unusual story indeed, something that only few people have experiences, or only few people decide to talk about it… Namely, at this moment Rebecca is in one old abandoned castle, and we have to add, very scary castle that is also known as the castle of the lost souls. You may ask yourself what she is doing there if the castle is that scary but this girl is there because of some personal reasons. Rebecca had an aunt that is late now. She loved her aunt very much and now when her aunt is looking for some help, Rebecca will do everything in order to help her. The aunt comes every night to Rebecca's dreams, telling her that she simply can't find her way.\r\n\r\nThings function little bit different in that world, the world of shadows and death but Rebecca will try to figure out what is going on with her aunt. She believes that the aunt is actually in the abandoned castle, together with the other lost souls who are looking for their way out, their way to redemption.\r\n\r\nThat's why this girl has decided to get into the castle, no matter how scary it is, and try to find the solution, to find out how could she help her aunt, but also to help the other souls that are closed in the castle, also looking for their way out.

The higher the level, the greater the reward\r\n- multilingual interface\r\n- original panoramic sound and music\r\n- additional DLC maps and campaigns with new enemies and towers\r\n- online worldwide leaderboards\r\n\r\nWe hope that Light Forces commanders, who loved the first part of Myth Defense, will be pleasantly surprised by the innovations in this part:\r\n• Enemies are now divided into classes: Live, Machine and Magic. Some towers affects only units of one class.\r\n• Moving platforms on the battlefield where you can build towers. Platform with a tower will move as close as possible to enemy units and attack them.\r\n• Some units (Dwarf and Paladin) wear armor. Armor absorbs 80% of low physical damage. Armor threshold is shown in the unit description which you can see by tapping on an enemy unit on the field. If tower causes more physical damage than the armor threshold, the armor breaks down and the unit gets full damage value. Armor doesn't protect units from other types of damage (fire , magic, etc)\r\n• Several fundamentally new towers:\r\n  - Fear Tower: scares enemy units, forcing them to run away from the tower for a while. One enemy can be scared only once (though some units are fearless).\r\n  - Cursed Tower: normally it shoots causing a base damage but can be charged with coins to temporarily multiply its power. If the health of the enemy unit does not exceed the base damage, the tower will kill it without spending extra-points. If the unit is strong tower will try to kill it, spending no more than enough extra-points.\r\n  - Jet Mace: shoots with a large spiked ball horizontally or vertically. It strikes several enemy units losing some destructive power each time. The ball continues to fly until it loses all the energy.\r\n  - Radioactive towers (Uranium and Plutonium): do not shoot, but continuously irradiates all units within damage radius. Golems and infected (by Plague or Poison Spider Tower) units are vulnerable to radiation.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDDCBH","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Crayola Color, Draw & Sing","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49700.9007199266382144.1c8a492d-8796-4eb4-ad98-5f6ac8875154.032c93b3-aa48-4296-8e61-9cac18a8d030","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9446.9007199266382144.1038c35c-1740-4a74-a035-201d2db581e4.87229bd8-67d3-4229-844c-7f8959869e4e","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"‪د.ك.‏‎ 1.500‬","Price":1.5,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["LegacyInteractive.CrayolaColorDrawSing_3fe15ghbg94v8"],"ContentIds":["c58a8714-641c-d0e8-4b94-40f5482a1537"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"كمبيوتر شخصي","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Crayola Color, Draw and Sing is a fun creativity app that combines the best of both art and music!

A series of exciting sound effects punctuates your child's taps and salutes them with uplifting chimes each time the problem is successfully completed, an option parents can customize within the app's preferences menu.\r\n\r\nThe game's activities help the children develop the following basic numbers and arithmetic skills:\r\n\r\nCounting\r\n\r\nChildren can learn their numbers from 1 to 20 by counting up, or down, using the app's large, kid-friendly back and forward buttons.\r\n\r\n{Parents can choose to have the numbers spoken in one of eight languages (English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Chinese, and Japanese) and set the numbers to appear sequentially or randomly.}\r\n\r\nRecognizing and Comparing Numbers\r\n\r\nTwo activities specifically encourage your child's number comparison and recognition skills: Find the Largest Number and Find the Smallest Number. With each game, a series of hot air balloons descend from the top of the screen and bob up and down. The narrator encourages the child to pick the balloon with the largest or the smallest number.\r\n\r\nThe constant motion and varying number of the balloons, from two to four, along with the large number range, from 1 to 99, promotes concentration and quick thinking.\r\n\r\nFinding a Match\r\n\r\nParents can encourage their child's memory skills with the Find a Match game. Based on the classic turn-over tile memory game format, children are prompted to find the matching numbers hiding beneath a field of cloud-shaped tiles. The number of clouds can be set in the context menu for this activity.\r\n\r\nLearning Addition and Subtraction\r\n\r\nTwo activities guide children through the basics of addition and subtraction using apples and pears, and a third, advanced exercise, combines the two.\r\n\r\nChildren are given a problem to solve, four answer choices, and visual clues to help them find the right answer.\r\n\r\nThe advanced exercise provides a series of combined addition and subtraction problems with numerals ranging from 1 to 99. The multiple choice format of the addition and subtraction games stays the same, but this activity eliminates visual references--no orchard fruit to help your child figure out the right answer.\r\n\r\nIf you want your child to learn math--and enjoy it--you'll love Kids Numbers and Math, and so will your little one!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDFZP4","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Kids ABC Trains Game","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41252.9007199266294593.1bcaf8c3-6b15-4fd9-8f9d-1f2fef383195.d0e88928-d8f3-4f6e-adcf-7e1a31ec8f33","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#2b5666","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7294.9007199266294593.ea6ccbe6-752a-4a22-a0e4-b4d28afa4d7b.c3cddddb-a630-4e5e-88ea-0755f9055665","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#2b5666","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3965.9007199266294593.9f57e256-8b15-443d-8537-083bc9cc1f57.30f7ca5f-e5ae-4073-b479-c78e5d622b9e","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#2b5666","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"‪د.ك.‏‎ 1.200‬","Price":1.2,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["Intellijoy.KidsABCTrainsGame_aeskzhp7pykjg"],"ContentIds":["2e21fdac-bdff-9709-3424-7649a15d1dd0","8fedd3af-2a1b-4de9-1b08-d3452fa8fec2","42f05667-7379-2e4b-6e6a-c5663b97fae3"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"كمبيوتر شخصي,جوال","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Intended for kids ages 2-7, Kids ABC Trains Game invites preschool-aged children to learn and identify letters and their sounds (phonics), using trains and railroads as their tools.\r\n\r\nWith Kids ABC Trains Game, your preschool-aged kids will learn each letter's name and sound, trace letter shapes, identify letters in context, and match lower to upper case letters.\r\n\r\nThe game has 5 activities:\r\n\r\n1.
