We specialize in educational games with the fun built right into them.\r\n\r\nLet's do the rest of the description in a question-and-answer form.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ How is the game played? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nIn the first lesson, children listen to the names of colors while a fun brush puts a big splash of the color on an easel, accompanied by an entertaining sound effect that makes the splash against the easel sound real.\r\n\r\nThen children learn how to recognize colors with a series of colorful jellyfish that float down with likable expressions on their faces. The pleasant lady announcer asks kids to choose the blue, yellow, purple, or black jellyfish. Each time children choose the correct one, she congratulates them with encouraging words like \"Perfect!\" and \"You're Good!\"\r\n\r\nNext, children discover how to build their color memories. An identical, pretty design shows up on the screen in rows. When kids tap on one of the designs, a color is revealed. Then the color disappears behind the design. Kids keep tapping until they remember where some of the colors are. Then when they tap on a design that matches one of the colors they remember the location of, they go back and tap it.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ What will my children learn? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nLike all Intellijoy games, the game focuses on a specific educational lesson, so children and their parents find the game really inviting and distraction-free.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, your child will learn:\r\n\r\n✔ The names of colors by splashing colors onto an easel.\r\n\r\n✔ How to recognize colors by being asked to do things like \"Choose the purple jellyfish.\"\r\n\r\n✔ Build memory skills by matching a color they've just seen.\r\n\r\nWe love to hear from parents – and from children, too. To tell us how we made a difference in your child's education or your sanity level, please rate our app and post a comment.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDV0L0","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Beach Buggy Racing","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60528.9007199266752395.04b4f55c-6f1f-45d5-8a75-681798e8e3d2.c9b8f0d8-b871-4ff3-a5c2-1347882a4b4c","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#0039AC","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26765.9007199266752395.c0250ca9-95e3-42bb-8989-081021d37c43.f59544a8-4d6b-4acb-b1c0-2431939d91e0","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#0039AC","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40082.9007199266752395.f8947a9e-3692-4ae0-bacd-75b0b7157f9c.a37d66d5-a0c7-4d67-ba6a-55f4576e39ce","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#0039AC","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55850.9007199266752395.821d3171-5dfd-4895-8786-108ef6dd2afe.2de2bdf9-761b-493e-80c9-440436ec8c83","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#0039AC","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12163.9007199266752395.8673fa24-4ec8-49a9-81f0-55886fe3e2c8.bec23cce-bcc2-42a6-bc8d-75ff6958a471","Height":434,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#0039AC","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61697.9007199266752395.7e6df814-8124-4e81-98c0-fe6e09b86098.cd54d2e4-0813-4b6d-af42-0407a3cc9b9e","Height":558,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#0039AC","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8800.9007199266752395.278d21a7-f881-4c09-b5fd-77eb9a3ea720.61bc8c49-a1f0-42ec-b3b3-12e5801bd167","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#0039AC","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44815.9007199266752395.18d4088b-eba1-4df5-b6f6-50221ac68e08.02eaaf9f-3eef-48f5-9411-155a479afe3e","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#0039AC","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56942.9007199266752395.1eb194ea-819e-4a1b-ac5e-675d6082f480.99e81e3c-5ced-4afc-9b65-6fa742dd781b","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#0039AC","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.4,"RatingsCount":"8","PackageFamilyNames":["VectorUnit.BeachBuggyRacing_hvbhrzr8672s2"],"ContentIds":["7f7349b9-5549-f756-1f3b-2ba7edb86432","d972520f-73be-9f7f-746e-72a828ca892d"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Beach Buggy is back with an explosive sequel!

10!\r\n\r\nSolitaire remains the most played computer game of all time, and for good reason. Simple rules and straightforward gameplay make it easy to pick up for everyone.\r\n\r\nSolitaire has been part of Windows for more than 25 years, and the Microsoft Solitaire Collection makes it the best experience to date with five different card games in one:\r\n\r\nKlondike\r\nThis version is the timeless classic that many people just call \"Solitaire.\" Try to clear all the cards from the table using one or three-card draw, while using traditional scoring or the Vegas scoring system.\r\n\r\nSpider\r\nEight columns of cards await your attempts to clear them with the fewest moves possible. Start out playing with a single suit until you’re comfortable, and then see how you fare when using two or even all four suits in a game.\r\n\r\nFreeCell\r\nUse four extra cells to move cards around as you try to clear all cards from the table. More strategic than the Klondike version, FreeCell rewards players who think several moves ahead.\r\n\r\nTriPeaks\r\nSelect cards in a sequence, either up or down, to earn points and clear the board. How many boards can you clear before you run out of deals?\r\n\r\nPyramid\r\nPair two cards that add up to 13 in order to remove them from the board. Try to reach the top of the pyramid. See how many boards you can clear and how high you can score in this highly addictive card game!\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges\r\nPlayers receive new challenges each day. Complete enough Daily Challenges in a month to earn badges and compete with your friends.\r\n\r\nStar Club\r\nEven more challenges arranged in collections and packs you can unlock by earning stars.\r\n\r\nChoose Your Theme\r\nThe Microsoft Solitaire Collection features several beautiful themes, from the simplicity of \"Classic\" to the serenity of an Aquarium that comes to life before you while you play. You can even create custom themes from your own photos!\r\n\r\nXbox Live Integration\r\nSign in with your Microsoft account to earn achievements, compete with your friends on the leaderboards, and track your personal gameplay statistics.

Recall your childhood!\r\n\r\nLudo game that traces its lineage to 6th century India. Ludo is derived from game Pachisi. Ludo is also very similar to Spanish board game.\r\n\r\nLudo game has stayed popular throughout the ages, varying only a little in its game structure. This persevering game is now available for you to play in an all new modernized format, i.e. as a video game application.\r\n\r\nThe game is played between 2 to 4 players and you have the option of playing the game against the computer, against your friends, or even against people from around the world. The objective of the game is pretty straightforward; each player gets 4 tokens, these tokens must make a full turn of the board and then make it to the finish line.\r\n\r\nWhoever gets all four tokens to the end first is the winner. However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided die, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a six. Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player’s token lands on the same square as your token, then your token will automatically be sent back home and you’ll need to roll a six again.\r\n\r\nLudo King is a game that was played by kings and now it can be enjoyed by you and your family and friends. While the game play might seem simple at first, the game is immensely enjoyable and challenging. You’ll be playing this one for hours and its fun for the whole family. Try to beat your opponents and compete for the highest scores on the leaderboards.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4X5FL","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Asphalt Xtreme","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7504.13510798887548491.c36dcdcd-c5bc-4c15-87a7-a9b275788f71.8030ab8f-5517-47c3-8881-ee9945594ddb","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60910.13510798887548491.7ea22a3e-8845-4ed1-9504-7e056cf6598a.d4ee927d-6389-4bad-9eb9-f803f6d1a842","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17832.13510798887548491.c002856f-21e6-4505-be61-1215981921aa.0546efa2-f869-45a8-bd1d-ef9478e55f1a","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7705.13510798887548491.ef385b12-f439-4816-bedf-d5a84c888b9f.a708ddfe-b34b-4b5e-bac4-bb66d62d9fb9","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49680.13510798887548491.72ecb88d-331b-4640-a4bf-f933218546a7.1785735f-c6bc-4181-8726-b724f137e304","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64683.13510798887548491.a4fed788-031a-463a-a55d-f4a66114dd19.cd1aab70-5382-4a94-95fa-4efd3feee342","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"8","PackageFamilyNames":["A278AB0D.AsphaltXtreme_h6adky7gbf63m"],"ContentIds":["3c487944-5dff-0959-0689-bdbc661722fa","9a4331f1-7152-9a2c-5a2f-5147b864defb"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"NO ROAD.

In 1291 the Archbishop of Canterbury in England threatened clergy who continued playing Chess with a diet of bread and water.  \r\nThe game has flourished over the years and is now one of the most popular board games in the world, requiring thought, skill and strategy to become successful.\r\n\r\nThe object of Chess is to capture the opponent's King.  To capture the King you must place it in check.  If the King cannot escape by itself, or with the help of its army, it is in checkmate and the King is captured.\r\n \r\nZingMagic’s multi award winning Chess application supports over 20 levels of play allowing you to play moves or games against the clock or relax and play at your own pace. Whatever level of Chess you choose, you can be sure that ZingMagic’s Chess will give you a fun, stimulating and challenging game.\r\n\r\nThis game is ad-funded.

But it this was war, and the law of a good soldier was a lack of feeling. Numbing my emotions and attachments to the people and places I visited was a challenge, but I soon realized the benefit... because now I was unstoppable.\r\n\r\n**** INTENSE GAME PLAY **** \r\nLaunch a fun, fast-paced 3D mobile gaming experience upon downloading this addictive FPS game.

Once the table is completely empty the game has been won.\r\n\r\nOne Suit Spider Solitaire is the best game to begin learning how to play this popular game, as it only has one suit of cards, which makes it the easiest. Played with 2 decks of cards, the goal is to form stacks with all the cards, King down to Ace. \r\n\r\nSpider Solitaire is similar to other types of solitaire (Klondike, patience, etc.). The goal of the game is to create 8 stacks of cards (king-through-ace). If all 10 foundations have at least one card, you may place additional cards by clicking on the \"stock cards\" in the bottom-right corner of the screen.\r\n\r\nSpider Solitaire comes in a number of different card games. 1 Suit Spider Solitaire (as the name implies) is played with only one suit (Spades). Unlike traditional (or Klondike) solitaire, however, you may place any cards of the same suit on top of one another. Just make sure that your cards are in ascending order!\r\n\r\nTest your skills and luck in this free Spider Solitaire game.\r\n\r\nDownload and enjoy the popular spider solitaire game and start playing now!\r\n\r\nSpider Solitaire is an addictive fun and enticing card game. \r\n\r\n◆◆◆◆ Spider Solitaire Features◆◆◆◆\r\n\r\n✔✔ Unlimited Smart Hints\r\n✔✔ Beautifully crafted graphics\r\n✔✔ Unlimited Undo Feature\r\n✔✔ Classic Style game-play\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you’re enjoying the game Spider Solitaire, please take a few seconds to give us a review!\r\n\r\nIt makes us happy to serve you even better! \r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NGKLB7H37JH","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Halo Wars 2: Awakening the Nightmare Demo","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56428.13644089702310628.1234ff76-ce8f-4ff2-9238-d4fa563c172d.38107930-0afd-4e84-a2e1-3a65f5345af4","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63371.13644089702310628.7e634768-59d2-4835-8a72-ea497d6dd826.6a43a874-d91e-4e21-b7a0-c959c2829fcf","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38867.13644089702310628.acc687ed-f0d2-4686-9dec-b09057157fd5.97f3cdde-a619-4aeb-84eb-59361c6d5997","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["Microsoft.HW2FFDemo_8wekyb3d8bbwe"],"ContentIds":["0fb7e28e-7756-f575-77cb-aa4a0b9a354d"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Experience the ultimate challenge as you defend your base against waves of enemy forces in this new game mode for Halo Wars 2: Awakening the Nightmare.
