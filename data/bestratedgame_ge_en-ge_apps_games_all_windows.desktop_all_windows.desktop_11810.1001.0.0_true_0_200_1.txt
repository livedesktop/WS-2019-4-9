The problem is that there are always new children coming into the room that want to play, run, jump, scream and just don’t want to keep quiet. Try to make these noisy babies sleep and have a sweet dream.\r\nTo make the babies sleep you will have to tap on those having the same pajama and see them disappear in a love blast. It is basically a match 3 game. The difference is that you will have to be very quick in finding the right combinations as the room is getting too narrow to keep so many babies. If you are too slow the babies will not be able to get any rest. Keep an eye on the babies light status while playing to understand if you are doing well or if the room is getting jam packed and the babies are not able to get their nap anymore.\r\n\r\n★★★Features: ★★★\r\n- Match 3 or more identical babies\r\n- Colorful graphics and smooth animations\r\n- 15 levels to play\r\n- Realistic baby sounds\r\n- Maximum points reachable with one move: 300\r\n\r\nUseful advice: You need to match at least 3 tiny babies to get points, if you touch just 2 of them they will disappear and empty the space they occupied before, but without giving you any points.\r\n\r\nWarning: If you touch in a place where no matching babies are, you will lose 50 points.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile you are proceeding through the levels, you will find a more and more messy room. In fact there will be toys spread all over the floor which will restrict the living space of these nice little kids, such as a ball, a colorful ring tower, a yellow duck, a green rubber hedgehog, a tender teddy bear etc. Try to master all the levels of this cute baby game and become the best nanny that this sunny kinder garden has ever had.\r\nUse all of your love to make these tiny babies sleep and make them vanish in a sweet heart blast.\r\n\r\nThis Babsy baby style app is a great baby game / kids game and one of the best children games!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDGZV4","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Dr. Panda's Daycare","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.43054.9007199266331987.5fdb6c86-e45c-4324-95b8-9c0d023fdf7c.8c502cfb-54ea-48be-832a-7da5713b76ff","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.2806.9007199266331987.2540c806-2869-4adc-ba2f-9fa3d6ac3a1e.52f94ee5-a623-41eb-a1dc-0e249e2860fc","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.56524.9007199266331987.59cfef78-ad6b-4fc2-ae92-5c7b95e9f527.fb2cfed1-dca1-44c7-9e3c-72f3bd64bf17","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.11322.9007199266331987.a6420694-b872-4a3c-9c34-9853f0cb5b4b.0fb75cd2-094d-47b8-bf15-efe80e5c165d","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.16769.9007199266331987.a32f72fe-3b25-4434-bff8-db112446eb2f.07be165d-03ac-4aef-93cc-c75f02057888","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.18895.9007199266331987.67ce3413-3adb-4740-95f6-2ab30d97fec7.a55f7496-6d01-452f-bd9c-7b1ff0edc2b2","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25626.9007199266331987.8fb317c3-a405-4cd6-bf1d-504c2fe90e78.69051158-51b1-4eb4-956d-f2ff0f27fc4c","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$1.99","Price":1.99,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["TribePlayLtd.Dr.PandasDaycare_p80trj3beywk8"],"ContentIds":["fa089b16-06ef-3073-d03f-a40255972ab2","6907e4dd-1f77-fa99-00e9-421222aee4d8","de542cb3-17dc-f457-6200-9624a031ba26"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"* TOP PICK ON SMARTAPPSFORKIDS.COM! “A creative role-playing game full of cute critters and fun interactivity which is going to be used for hours and hours of creative play by your young ones”\r\n\r\n* WIRED “This charming preschooler game promotes role-playing and creativity for young children”\r\n\r\n* GIGGLEAPPS “Dr. Panda’s Daycare is a delightful role-playing app for toddlers and those in preschool”\r\n\r\nImagine and play in Dr. Panda’s Daycare!

Build, expand, plan your strategy, the decision is in your hands!\r\nBut don’t stop there, recruit dozens of funny characters, add them to your collection and watch as they populate the streets and bring your city to life!\r\n\r\nBuild the BEST. CITY. EVER.\r\n- Craft hundreds of unique, gorgeous buildings in your city and expand it from a tiny, peaceful town to a big, bustling metropolis.\r\n- Don’t forget to decorate your skyline by building famous landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, the Tower of London or the Tower of Pisa (there’s something for every tower fan) to elevate your city to the top tourist destinations.\r\n\r\nMeet your new family \r\n- Cartoon fans rejoice! Meet and collect tons of funny characters with their own unique personalities, like the portly Sergeant Cakemore, or the uber-macho builder guy, Forest Manly (whose real skill is the tiny bit too suggestive eyebrow raise).\r\n- Build a water tower. Check! Build a fire station. Check! But who’s going to drive the fire truck? Assigning citizens to jobs will help you optimize your city, but you can go even further! Send them on missions and they won’t come home empty handed or do favors for them so they would invite their friends too to fill your city!\r\n\r\nFusion is the way to go\r\n- The future: age of smart forks, exploding hover boards, even selfies! But now the 21st century lives up to its promise, with the ability to merge buildings into advanced skyscrapers and unlock specializations.\r\n- Unlocking each allows you to develop your city towards different directions and expand your collection with specialized buildings such as Sustainability, Commerce, Education and Entertainment. Choose which one suits your strategy best!\r\n\r\nThe grass is always greener…\r\n- But is it really? Find out by visiting the cities of your friends. Is your friend the best builder you know? Well, you can always “borrow” a bit of their ideas to improve your game … sshhh, we won’t tell anyone…\r\n- In case you find yourself short on some crucial resources, visiting the Trade HQ should be a major part of your strategy, it is where you can collect some extra cash or find missing upgrade items.\r\n\r\n\r\n**** Game not optimized for Nokia 2520.\r\n\r\n_____________________________________________\r\n\r\nVisit our official site at http://gmlft.co/website_EN\r\nCheck out the new blog at http://gmlft.co/central\r\n\r\nDon't forget to follow us on social media:\r\nFacebook: http://gmlft.co/SNS_FB_EN\r\nTwitter: http://gmlft.co/SNS_TW_EN\r\nInstagram: http://gmlft.co/GL_SNS_IG\r\nYouTube: http://gmlft.co/GL_SNS_YT\r\n\r\nThis app allows you to purchase virtual items within the app and may contain third party advertisements that may redirect you to a third party site.\r\n\r\nPrivacy Policy: http://www.gameloft.com/en/privacy-notice\r\nTerms of Use: http://www.gameloft.com/en/conditions-of-use\r\nEnd-User License Agreement: http://www.gameloft.com/en/eula","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH5LNFG","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Fruits Saga - Match 3 Adventure","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54659.13510798887174179.73bb6047-d7db-4d27-a4b1-c447c60c9d5f.2e5d5cd2-cfd8-4ea8-9004-cf892a378d50","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.11852.13510798887174179.890ff17c-169f-4a1b-9bbc-1da25403d1f7.4c110aac-2bb6-4bd7-9f3b-5d257f76eb48","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54659.13510798887174179.73bb6047-d7db-4d27-a4b1-c447c60c9d5f.2e5d5cd2-cfd8-4ea8-9004-cf892a378d50","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.5,"RatingsCount":"2","PackageFamilyNames":["40588MidwayStudios.FruitsSaga-Match3Adventure_svrvwanpjnagm"],"ContentIds":["9f1720df-6e19-3024-28ba-b5ebf9d31599","2f567226-6011-e237-6320-47d4b2d356f6","bd7e0e26-fbe1-15b0-5c2a-de774c1d8bc6"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Fruits Saga - Match 3 Adventure is a new 3-match FREE game.

of city building and tower defense awesomeness!\r\n\r\nUNIQUE SIMULATION + STRATEGY GAMING\r\nTake back the wilderness from the invading bloon hordes and pop your way from a modest settlement to a thriving metropolis. Attack bloon-infested territory adjacent to your city, win a short tower defense game, and add the captured territory to your city as a space on which to build. Buildings are the heart of your city, and each one has a specific purpose - individual monkey towers for battle, upgrades for those towers, farms and banks to drive your economy, power to supercharge your city, epic buildings for epic powers, and decorations to make your city more awesome. Every time you build, your city looks cooler, you increase your power potential in tower defense play, and you open up even more rewards and challenges.\r\n\r\nAMAZING DEPTH AND VARIETY\r\nAll 21 of the fully awesomized and carefully balanced Bloons TD 5 towers are available within Monkey City, with completely new unlock mechanics. More than 130 buildings and decorations give you endless strategies and city design options. Explore the wilderness to find treasure tiles and uncover 11 powerful special items like the Banana Replicator and the Dark Temple Idol. Burst bloons on 55 all new tower defense maps or test your mastery on 13 wildly challenging original special missions. Either way, be ready to encounter all new bloon waves and special bloon attack patterns like Cash Starve or Fast and Furious.\r\n\r\nREINFORCE YOUR FRIENDS\r\nConnect with Facebook friends, then help each other win and expand. Send Supply Crates back and forth for bonus starting cash. Visit friends' cities to check out their strategies and their city design skills, and while you're there root out any bloon spies to win a reward for both you and your friend.\r\n\r\nSHOW OFF YOUR SKILLS\r\nBuild up the strongest lineup of monkey towers possible and compete with other players for the best score in weekly Contested Territory events. Use the latest in monkey science to send player vs. player bloon attacks, then see whose defenses are the strongest and earn extra rewards for victory.\r\n\r\nDownload for free and play Bloons Monkey City now!\r\n\r\nPlease Note:\r\nBloons Monkey City is free to download and play (aside from internet, carrier, data, device, and other services for which the player is financially responsible), but some in-game items can be purchased with real money.

Compete against players from around the world in a high speed online race.\r\n\r\nFUN DRIVING \r\nTraffic Race 3D 2 is a mixture of arcade racing and casual driving on open tracks. No more re-spawns when you hit the race track border. Go crazy and find the fastest route on each track. \r\n\r\nENDLESS RUNNER GAME MODE \r\nWe’ve invented a combination of endless running mode with a checkpoint system. You will not die because you crash, your car will take damage but just keep on going for as far as you can! \r\n\r\nGLOBAL HIGH SCORE\r\nAre you the best driver in the world? Now you can prove it! Show the world that you are the next Schumacher or Hamilton. Can you make it to 1st place in the global rank? We reset ranks every week on Mondays to keep the competition alive.  \r\n\r\nARCADE RACING PHYSICS\r\nWe’ve taken inspiration from all extreme motor sports: Nascar, F1, Le mans, Rally and then we’ve stripped it down to a casual driving experience. This lets you drift around corners at 240 km/h with your car while still having fun and do crash as often as you wish. \r\n\r\nSUITABLE FOR ALL AGES (PEGI 3)\r\nEveryone can enjoy Traffic Race 3D 2. You will actually probably become a better real driver regardless if you are an adult, teenager or child. \r\n\r\nINTUITIVE CONTROLS\r\nThe goal of this game is to make it easy and fast to run on any device (Mobile, PC, Tablet). \r\n\r\nCAMERA OF YOUR CHOICE\r\nWe’ve added the opportunity for you to switch camera mode between Chase, Helicopter or cockpit view so you really feel that you are driving a real car.  \r\n\r\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE – AI DRIVERS\r\nOur game includes AI drivers but our drivers are not perfect. They make mistakes and will not always stay on the track, probably just like you :o)\r\n\r\n100% FREE – WE PROMISE\r\nYou can unlock all cars and courses for free. You do not need to buy any smurf coins to play this game. Each time you race you gain coins to unlock cars. Courses can only be unlocked by achieving the best times on each track.  We do offer one IAP and we call it “All Inclusive”, it gives you all cars and eliminates all ads. \r\n\r\nFEEDBACK\r\nWe are listening to feedback from our users.

A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line. Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans.\r\n\r\nIt’s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. It’s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control. Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. Highly skilled drivers control a high powered street car past its limit, sideways at high speed, burning rubber. It can’t get any better!\r\n____________________________________\r\n\r\nSUPPORT: http://en.ratrodstudio.com/support/ \r\nVISIT US: http://ratrodstudio.com\r\nFOLLOW US: twitter.com/ratrodstudio","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJCGH","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Need for Racing: New Speed Car on Real Asphalt Tracks","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.64541.9007199266251752.264db8f9-ff10-4c7f-9132-7fe22e388174.65b3b9a5-cee2-4cd1-b8f7-a82495de58bd","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.39008.9007199266251752.0c9b99d7-5972-4f66-acbf-7993f8624a2a.7fca17dd-7ea0-4f3d-b099-764c815d2706","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.46743.9007199266251752.9bd9d013-c8bc-4df4-aa35-416131bbb7c6.06c89881-9d17-4797-80a7-1ae89e398482","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.34184.9007199266251752.a5ca945e-8951-4a29-a687-5dedb2a256d5.986befe4-6525-4cb6-bdd0-6c9fef00681d","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.21966.9007199266251752.4665982e-fb68-4ecc-8001-0ec943f9d13a.a4f3a2c6-2c2f-42f0-a6c8-79a85998b0ec","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.24691.9007199266251752.684a5527-8b37-4438-9f3b-c568055064cf.d8b2257c-07eb-47eb-8257-1fb2e63d81f5","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.0,"RatingsCount":"8","PackageFamilyNames":["C40DCF4F.NeedforRacingNewSpeedCaronRealAsphaltTrac_b6sb9g8avsqk2"],"ContentIds":["24958f99-f4bf-51e3-709e-e2844ca4f437"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Participate in high-octane racing competition in 10 different racing modes.

After all, they have so many beneficial vitamins. And each of them is unlike the other. Red, blue, and green, large and small, hard and soft. Some are sweet, others sour, and still more are salty. You might think that each fruit has its own personality. Merry strawberries, clumsy cabbages, and carefree oranges. I wonder what they would be like if they could live among us? We decided to indulge our imaginations and presented each fruit in its own characteristic way. The result turned out to be very interesting and fun!\r\n\r\nConnect points is a learning puzzle for small children. It helps develop thinking, improve memory and attention. The application has three game modes: by numbers, letters and coloring. Game modes with letters and numbers will be useful for kindergarten and pre-K kids. \r\nConnecting by numbers will help to easily memorize the order of numbers and learn to count. To do this, you need to consecutively connect circles with numbers starting from 1. As you connect circles in the right order, the silhouette of a hidden picture will become more and more visible. If three points are chosen incorrectly, a tip will pop up. Once all the points are fully connected, the picture will become fully visible and you’ll be able to color it.\r\nThose studying the alphabet can choose to connect points by letters. It is important that children know letters as early as possible, since it is essential for learning to read and write. But knowing the order of letters in the alphabet is also very important! This can be achieved by connecting circles with letters in the right sequence.\r\nThe coloring mode will be especially appreciated by young artists. In this mode, you can proceed to coloring pictures without connecting points. To make the process even more exciting, you can change any predefined color. To do this, press and hold the paint bucket and choose the necessary color from the palette.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJ31L","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Spider Solitaire HD","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.59825.9007199266246027.0550894b-417c-4cb9-bcf5-4440144f70a6.6f6eb2f7-ee74-456c-adcd-ffbd5cd68910","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#962A95","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.33023.9007199266246027.cc1511ed-eb2d-472b-bf74-40de64426d88.01d655d8-f1d3-4dc2-8898-837051a5b18d","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#962A95","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63816.9007199266246027.49ec7d9c-a30a-4af7-9c59-1b6af71a78f6.4c222430-35d6-4bcc-b85a-7e77c56a254a","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#962A95","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":1.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["32988BernardoZamora.SpiderSolitaireHD_1fgex2kbsn6g8"],"ContentIds":["479ffce7-8364-5067-5bd4-de93271ed228","f17753ee-2876-18ca-297d-e2bb8b98da79","7972ec7a-2d9b-ca6b-fcc7-8205538a8e1f"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"#1 Spider Solitaire -- 6,000,000 downloads, thank you!\r\n\r\nPlay the traditional patience game of Spider Solitaire you already know and love, no internet needed, just start and play.
