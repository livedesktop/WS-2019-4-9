It is played on a square board, made of 64 smaller squares, with eight squares on each side. Each player starts with sixteen pieces: eight pawns, two knights, two bishops, two rooks, one queen and one king. The goal of the game is for each player to try and checkmate the king of the opponent. Checkmate is a threat ('check') to the opposing king which no move can stop. It ends the game.\r\nDuring the game the two opponents take turns to move one of their pieces to a different square of the board. One player ('White') has pieces of a light color; the other player ('Black') has pieces of a dark color. There are rules about how pieces move, and about taking the opponent's pieces off the board. The player with white pieces always makes the first move. Because of this, White has a small advantage, and wins more often than Black in tournament games.\r\nDeveloping Chess strategy and improving your Chess skill! Face the challenge, become the best chess player!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NCSZMF2HCVV","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Moto Rider GO: Highway Traffic","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47964.13561718767588861.0be8c0cb-b4ec-40fc-95f1-05b18227f5c6.25de4697-f517-44eb-b7ef-e91261491767","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40680.13561718767588861.50750d41-e5b5-4383-a2c3-202983506ad7.9bcc1783-8848-4b46-a540-20414dec98cd","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27115.13561718767588861.856decad-7636-4e09-b906-8a95db5cd747.2b40a6ca-9052-473d-99e8-8aaf2654ddfe","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4277.13561718767588861.f637756e-0c8c-4145-b278-e2fd0e43844a.ad725306-91d7-499f-87a8-131fc019ef6c","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["C40DCF4F.MotoRiderGOHighwayTraffic_b6sb9g8avsqk2"],"ContentIds":["5d3e31fe-adf6-8466-a05d-bc3ec258658c","6c54c991-93be-e556-4e6b-81e8a7e09035"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Moto Rider GO: Highway Traffic brings to you one of the most compelling and satisfying traffic dodging experience in the world!\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Choose from the fastest high-performance motorcycles!\r\n- Enjoy extreme 3D visuals!\r\n- Prove your skills in hardcore challenges!\r\n- Upgrade your speed, breaking level and add extra lives!\r\n- Select your favorite motorbike category: chopper, cross or superbike!\r\n- Make near traffic misses discovering 4 unique locations: Suburbs, Desert, Snow and Night City\r\n- Explore 4 unique locations in 4 different modes!\r\n- Ride your motorcycle on a highway, interstate, or the autobahn!\r\n- Dominate online leaderboards!\r\n- Unlock 23 achievements!\r\n- Discover plenty of bike tuning options!\r\n\r\nENDLESS GAMEPLAY\r\nHead out and race as fast as you can to become the best new moto rider in the world!

In 1291 the Archbishop of Canterbury in England threatened clergy who continued playing Chess with a diet of bread and water.  \r\nThe game has flourished over the years and is now one of the most popular board games in the world, requiring thought, skill and strategy to become successful.\r\n\r\nThe object of Chess is to capture the opponent's King.  To capture the King you must place it in check.  If the King cannot escape by itself, or with the help of its army, it is in checkmate and the King is captured.\r\n \r\nZingMagic’s multi award winning Chess application supports over 20 levels of play allowing you to play moves or games against the clock or relax and play at your own pace. Whatever level of Chess you choose, you can be sure that ZingMagic’s Chess will give you a fun, stimulating and challenging game.\r\n\r\nThis game is ad-funded.

The 28 domino tiles are shuffled face down and form the stock or boneyard. Each player draws seven tiles; the remainder are not used. Once the players begin drawing tiles, they are typically placed on-edge before the players, so that each player can see his own domino tiles, but none can see the value of other players' tiles. Every player can thus see how many tiles remain in the other players' hands at all times during gameplay. One player begins by downing (playing the first tile) one of their tiles. In different games first tiles are also different. In Muggins player should start with the highest double (6-6), in Bergen the first move should be 0-0, in Mexican train each round starts with the next lower double. This tile starts the line of play, a series of tiles in which adjacent tiles touch with matching, i.e. equal, values. The players alternately extend the line of play with one tile at one of its two ends. The game ends when one player wins by playing their last tile, or when the game is blocked because neither player can play. If that occurs, whoever caused the block gets all of the remaining player points not counting their own.\r\n- Scoring game\r\nPlayers accrue points during game play for certain configurations, moves, or emptying one's hand. Most scoring games use variations of the draw game. In Muggins (All fives) player must make the open ends of the layout add up to 5s or a multiple of five (5s, 10, 15, 20, etc.) In bergen player scores when numbers on the open ends are equal. If a player does not call \"domino\" before the tile is laid on the table, and another player says 'domino' after the tile is laid, the first player must pick up an extra domino. In Mexican train the double zero domino is scored as 50 points.\r\n- Draw game\r\nIn a draw game (blocking or scoring), players are additionally allowed to draw as many tiles as desired from the stock before playing a tile. The score of a game is the number of pips in the losing player's hand plus the number of pips in the stock. Most rules prescribe that two tiles need to remain in the stock. The Draw game is often referred to as simply \"dominos\".\r\n\r\nIf you like board games like Checkers, Mahjong, Backgammon and Chess, you will love Dominoes: Best Classic Dominoes Board

The Tetris game was created by Alexey Pajitnov in 1984—the product of Alexey’s computer programming experience and his love of puzzles. In the decades to follow, Tetris became one of the most successful and recognizable  games, appearing on nearly every gaming platform available. This App is based on the classic Tetris, a new development in windows10!\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE\r\n\r\nThe goal of Tetris is to score as many points as possible by clearing horizontal lines of Blocks. The player must rotate, move, and drop the falling Tetriminos inside the Matrix (playing field). Lines are cleared when they are filled with Blocks and have no empty spaces.\r\n\r\nAs lines are cleared, the level increases and Tetriminos fall faster, making the game progressively more challenging. If the Blocks land above the top of the playing field, the game is over.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9P44R51Z21WW","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Digital World Evolution: Global Server","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10163.14599981632211534.b8ad1c16-6a7a-4428-b458-8e54b6607c2a.3605e3b9-f773-4e09-93a6-57cb19ebc76b","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50534.14599981632211534.b8ad1c16-6a7a-4428-b458-8e54b6607c2a.c10624fe-d8f3-41eb-9ac8-bde61f81124f","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49389.14599981632211534.b8ad1c16-6a7a-4428-b458-8e54b6607c2a.b6f4eda6-39d9-4f31-a0eb-01d97dbd4f24","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7424.14599981632211534.b8ad1c16-6a7a-4428-b458-8e54b6607c2a.370d47da-e05d-47bd-a9cf-12385a25e3e9","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.21333.14599981632211534.b8ad1c16-6a7a-4428-b458-8e54b6607c2a.7f0e362e-4d92-48ea-a260-4b07ae392f72","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.21863.14599981632211534.b8ad1c16-6a7a-4428-b458-8e54b6607c2a.e3a94d58-35fd-4bcb-b584-0c3f831b7bcf","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57260.14599981632211534.b8ad1c16-6a7a-4428-b458-8e54b6607c2a.43936c43-34b3-45b2-b736-f1e75c2ae0eb","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.11839.14599981632211534.b8ad1c16-6a7a-4428-b458-8e54b6607c2a.ec2118d2-2608-4658-bc68-46b0e2a47271","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63653.14599981632211534.b8ad1c16-6a7a-4428-b458-8e54b6607c2a.53139e26-3e60-4208-ba91-361ccc31263b","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35869.14599981632211534.225fa568-1976-4b39-941f-a6c4277fbe4a.d9a60add-69be-4e9e-ba75-7c6fe86c4064","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["60066DreamfiiHKLimited.DigitalMonsterGoEvolution_62vv3d7v2r0ta"],"ContentIds":["321bd8e9-7ef1-eb5b-9c6f-8fb1b601e0d0"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"《Digital World Evolution: Global Server》is a game based on \"Digimon\".The game supports both English and Chinese, Global service,reproduce the classic!

of city building and tower defense awesomeness!\r\n\r\nUNIQUE SIMULATION + STRATEGY GAMING\r\nTake back the wilderness from the invading bloon hordes and pop your way from a modest settlement to a thriving metropolis. Attack bloon-infested territory adjacent to your city, win a short tower defense game, and add the captured territory to your city as a space on which to build. Buildings are the heart of your city, and each one has a specific purpose - individual monkey towers for battle, upgrades for those towers, farms and banks to drive your economy, power to supercharge your city, epic buildings for epic powers, and decorations to make your city more awesome. Every time you build, your city looks cooler, you increase your power potential in tower defense play, and you open up even more rewards and challenges.\r\n\r\nAMAZING DEPTH AND VARIETY\r\nAll 21 of the fully awesomized and carefully balanced Bloons TD 5 towers are available within Monkey City, with completely new unlock mechanics. More than 130 buildings and decorations give you endless strategies and city design options. Explore the wilderness to find treasure tiles and uncover 11 powerful special items like the Banana Replicator and the Dark Temple Idol. Burst bloons on 55 all new tower defense maps or test your mastery on 13 wildly challenging original special missions. Either way, be ready to encounter all new bloon waves and special bloon attack patterns like Cash Starve or Fast and Furious.\r\n\r\nREINFORCE YOUR FRIENDS\r\nConnect with Facebook friends, then help each other win and expand. Send Supply Crates back and forth for bonus starting cash. Visit friends' cities to check out their strategies and their city design skills, and while you're there root out any bloon spies to win a reward for both you and your friend.\r\n\r\nSHOW OFF YOUR SKILLS\r\nBuild up the strongest lineup of monkey towers possible and compete with other players for the best score in weekly Contested Territory events. Use the latest in monkey science to send player vs. player bloon attacks, then see whose defenses are the strongest and earn extra rewards for victory.\r\n\r\nDownload for free and play Bloons Monkey City now!\r\n\r\nPlease Note:\r\nBloons Monkey City is free to download and play (aside from internet, carrier, data, device, and other services for which the player is financially responsible), but some in-game items can be purchased with real money.
