The game takes full advantage of stunning Unity 3D graphics to provide a visually rich experience.   \r\n\r\n[Contact Us]\r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AstroLordsWin10/\r\n\r\nYou will take on the role of an Astro Lord, leader of your own asteroids in the Oort Cloud on the fringes of the solar system. As well as vying against other players for dominance in PVP combat, you must also face off against a mysterious alien race which has invaded the Cloud.   \r\n\r\n[Game Features]\r\n---Build your  asteroids---\r\n Asteroids are at the heart of your Empire. You begin the game with a home asteroid which you must develop through the construction of facilities such as mines, power plants, factories and laboratories. Resources must be gathered, or stolen, to construct ammunition and cyborgs to fuel your expansion. Secondary asteroids can be added through colonising empty ones, or capturing developed asteroids from your enemies.   \r\n\r\n---A unique battle mode,brings you a new game experience---\r\n《Star Lord: Space Exploration》is the first MMORTS to feature moving bases on a spherical map, putting you in the driving seat. Will you manoeuvre your asteroid in pursuit of your enemies, flee from hostile foes, or explore vast nebulae and alien ruins? \r\n\r\n---Shoot!  Lead the fleet and defeat the enemy of space with allies---\r\nLeading the charge against your enemies are the Captains. You can recruit up to 6 Captains from 7 different classes. Will you recruit a Warrior and focus your efforts on combat? A Scientist, to boost your research output? A Spy, to keep tabs on other Astro Lords and alien bases? With over 50 different skills to develop, you can tailor your Captains to suit your gameplay style. Each Captain can be fully controlled in battle against other players and AI alien enemies, and will fight to defend your base while you're offline too.   Captains and starbases can be improved through skills, runes, artifacts and officers, giving you complete control over your combat style and abilities.

Check! Build a fire station. Check! But who’s going to drive the fire truck? Assigning citizens to jobs will help you optimize your city, but you can go even further! Send them on missions and they won’t come home empty handed or do favors for them so they would invite their friends too to fill your city!\r\n\r\nFusion is the way to go\r\n- The future: age of smart forks, exploding hover boards, even selfies! But now the 21st century lives up to its promise, with the ability to merge buildings into advanced skyscrapers and unlock specializations.\r\n- Unlocking each allows you to develop your city towards different directions and expand your collection with specialized buildings such as Sustainability, Commerce, Education and Entertainment. Choose which one suits your strategy best!\r\n\r\nThe grass is always greener…\r\n- But is it really? Find out by visiting the cities of your friends. Is your friend the best builder you know? Well, you can always “borrow” a bit of their ideas to improve your game … sshhh, we won’t tell anyone…\r\n- In case you find yourself short on some crucial resources, visiting the Trade HQ should be a major part of your strategy, it is where you can collect some extra cash or find missing upgrade items.\r\n\r\n\r\n**** Game not optimized for Nokia
