The memories still burn deeply, like spicy chicken wings.\r\n\r\n\"They came without warning, squawking menacingly, their ruffled feathers darkening the sun. Invading intergalactic chickens, out to punish humanity for our oppression of their earthly brethren.\r\n\r\n\"I instantly knew what had to be done. I dropped my half-eaten chicken burger and jumped in my cockpit. With a greasy finger I set my lasers to \"extra crispy\" and blasted off to intercept the fowl invaders.\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't easy. Squawks, feathers flying, the smell of charred chicken everywhere. Three times they invaded, each time with increasingly devious plans. Three times I managed to push them back whence they came, and secure humanity a few more years as the dominant species of this planet.\r\n\r\n\"After their last retreat, I headed for my local Space Burger to bask in the glow of my recent victory. Breathing a sigh of relief, I sat down to enjoy a double chicken-burger with crispy chicken wings on the side.\r\n\r\n\"Little did I know that my greatest adventure was yet to come...\"\r\n\r\n\"Ultimate Omelette\" is the title of the fourth episode in the Chicken Invaders series of casual space shooter games. The game puts players at the forefront of a battle against invading intergalactic chickens, bent on revenge against the human race for our oppression of Earth chickens. In this episode, the chickens have constructed a gigantic cannon capable of launching planet-scale eggs against Earth, with the ultimate goal of encrusting humanity in an impenetrable wall made of egg white. Joined by an unlikely ally, players will travel to foreign, unexplored galaxies in an effort to locate and destroy the egg cannon before it reaches Earth.\r\n\r\nThe enemy repertoire has been significantly broadened, introducing several different kinds of chickens which attack relentlessly in colorful groups and meticulously choreographed formations. The chicken fray is punctuated by fights against boss enemies spanning up to three times the size of the screen. The arsenal at the player's disposal has also been correspondingly extended, with three new weapons and four kinds of supporting satellites providing additional firepower. The player's intergalactic journey is also accentuated by unique fantastic scenarios, such as navigating through a field of gigantic floating feathers, or dodging molten planet chunks during a supernova explosion.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

planet.\r\nYou will be a lovely employee of this big kinder garden where you will have to take care of many hyper active children.\r\nYour task is to make them feel at home and to make them sleep once in a while. The problem is that there are always new children coming into the room that want to play, run, jump, scream and just don’t want to keep quiet. Try to make these noisy babies sleep and have a sweet dream.\r\nTo make the babies sleep you will have to tap on those having the same pajama and see them disappear in a love blast. It is basically a match 3 game. The difference is that you will have to be very quick in finding the right combinations as the room is getting too narrow to keep so many babies. If you are too slow the babies will not be able to get any rest. Keep an eye on the babies light status while playing to understand if you are doing well or if the room is getting jam packed and the babies are not able to get their nap anymore.\r\n\r\n★★★Features: ★★★\r\n- Match 3 or more identical babies\r\n- Colorful graphics and smooth animations\r\n- 15 levels to play\r\n- Realistic baby sounds\r\n- Maximum points reachable with one move: 300\r\n\r\nUseful advice: You need to match at least 3 tiny babies to get points, if you touch just 2 of them they will disappear and empty the space they occupied before, but without giving you any points.\r\n\r\nWarning: If you touch in a place where no matching babies are, you will lose 50 points.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile you are proceeding through the levels, you will find a more and more messy room. In fact there will be toys spread all over the floor which will restrict the living space of these nice little kids, such as a ball, a colorful ring tower, a yellow duck, a green rubber hedgehog, a tender teddy bear etc. Try to master all the levels of this cute baby game and become the best nanny that this sunny kinder garden has ever had.\r\nUse all of your love to make these tiny babies sleep and make them vanish in a sweet heart blast.\r\n\r\nThis Babsy baby style app is a great baby game / kids game and one of the best children games!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDDGC0","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Rat on a Skateboard","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25603.9007199266384805.24ee88ce-d671-49d8-96d1-906a5d587e27.a4769cf1-bfcb-41fe-a0e0-dcc6591a34cd","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#002030","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58863.9007199266384805.98ca6738-b5b2-4192-940b-3bf0a2ee1ae4.317c7aa6-959e-4887-bc3a-d44a2674a84f","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#002030","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"‪ل.ل.‏‎ 2,700.00‬","Price":2700.0,"AverageRating":4.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["DonutGames.RatonaSkateboard_pt1hwfcp9ekx8"],"ContentIds":["38d1f595-7599-e733-46e6-4c882dce6b92"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Grab that board and get ready for a kick-flippin' adventure down the Banana Harbor.\r\nThe game includes both randomly generated tracks for endless game play, and 70 carefully handcrafted tracks to master.\r\n\r\nReady to stack up some serious scores?\r\nThen you better start grinding those handrails, stomp those garbage cans and grab some cool stunt power-ups!\r\n\r\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nWHAT REVIEWERS SAY:\r\n\r\n- Touch Arcade: \"This latest offering features all the hallmarks of a Donut Games release – colorful pixel art, simple game mechanics, and high replay value.

One of the Microsoft developers noticed this version and implemented a version for Windows. It was first included with Win32s as an application that enabled the testing of the 32-bit thunking layer (does anyone remember what that was?). FreeCell remained relatively obscure until it was released as part of Windows 95. \r\nSince then the game has been ported to numerous platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We largely tried to recreate a full experience of the game in a tiny download package, including power moves, hints and undo (top right corner of the title bar). But there are also some minor twists to make it easier to play on a small factor mobile devices. In particular you don't have to select a card to move - drag and drop entire column - only appropriate cards will move, the rest will snap back. The cards will be moved to foundation automatically when possible. The scoring is also changed - only number of moves counted - the lower the score - the better. \r\n\r\nOnly the top (exposed) card of each tableau pile is available for play. It may be moved to a foundation pile, a free cell, or to another tableau pile. Within the tableau, cards are built down in sequence and alternating in color. Any card may be moved into an empty space. Blocks of cards may not be moved, unless the requisite number of free cells and/or tableau spaces are available to allow each individual card to be moved. To move part of partial pile, drag whole pile - the game will self adjust. If you fill all four foundation piles, you win. \r\nIf you don't see any more moves try hints, undo (top right corner) to back track, or menu to start new game.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJCM8","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Card Games Chest","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.5267.9007199266251385.6db487cc-3208-4d1b-905d-b47eaf94e792.17453aaa-4013-4f31-82b3-542ed8bf76d2","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#114621","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.45811.9007199266251385.7813c2db-8f57-4709-8b46-9500863134a5.18c0b5b7-ecad-4ca9-9233-1b64b17b7d17","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#114621","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.58687.9007199266251385.c974dc05-6248-4c97-81df-29e9cdf306f5.11880b49-a344-4648-ab41-1e0df7bba523","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#114621","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.65416.9007199266251385.a11436ae-ace7-4435-87d6-99d789d28076.492b97d0-98fa-410d-b9ab-21cfaf8feb43","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#114621","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33841.9007199266251385.efe165f8-649c-4f04-8ef4-eca56e3e0557.6335b537-e1a3-4cd7-bfa0-d004cfe97455","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#114621","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.932.9007199266251385.62bd43d2-6abf-46df-943c-232d86b57aaa.e32bb605-0d59-40e9-9dd5-c71857fd795c","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#114621","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36496.9007199266251385.f391b50c-e02a-468e-9ff5-73cd7a7c019e.3b0b2d2f-c12a-45e5-a700-527011430aa2","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#114621","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13389.9007199266251385.89a1cfb4-9d80-4173-81ce-cf7ce6df693c.d9b0ceb0-aa72-4f14-9256-df18bf61e498","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#114621","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["43248SummitDataCorp.CardGamesChest_hmd3687kaknfw"],"ContentIds":["43204d81-362d-7a9b-41b7-0e30578ab917","261d259e-2725-a7b3-1463-7bcf1f454fdb","99f8e4e2-2020-8434-1d39-78b0dd537d38"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Play world's top card games from one beautiful app: Crazy Eights, Solitaire, Spider Solitaire, Mau-Mau, 101, Switch and DUO.

Speed is a game associated with the game Nertz. \r\n\r\nControls: Drag the cards \r\n\r\nObjective: To play all your cards first.\r\n\r\nHow to Play:\r\n\r\n-Each player is dealt five cards to form a hand, and each player is dealt 15 cards face down to form a draw pile. If you are playing with jokers, you use them as wild cards and give each draw pile 16 cards. A stack of five cards, placed face down on each side between the players, serves as a replacement pile.

This thrilling mystery merges elements of classical horror and gritty, 50’s-style noir. \r\n\r\nA paranormal private investigator is contacted by her friend, famous reporter Helen Hunter, whose voice sounds small and terrified in the voicemail. She is in the coastal town of Serpent Creek, and needs help immediately.  \r\n\r\nBut upon arriving in Serpent Creek, the detective finds no trace of Ms. Hunter. And the manager of the nearby hotel, in which she supposedly stayed, claims to have never even seen her.\r\n\r\nWeirder still is the fact the town’s streets are crawling with snakes, and the citizens seem to be sleepwalking through life. The ground shakes with violent tremors.\r\n\r\nThis case will certainly challenge the protagonist’s skills as a detective. She must save her friend, reveal the corruption and hidden agendas of the town’s citizens, and, most importantly, stop an evil plot to bring the Snake God back to our world.\r\n\r\nWhen investigating Serpent Creek, the detective will perform true investigative work: finding clues and combining them to learn the secrets of every crime scene in the all new Detective Mode!

Also it could be made mandatory to leave the last peg in a specific location (target position).\r\n\r\nIf there are 32 pegs on the board, one must make 31 moves to solve the puzzle.

A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line. Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans.\r\n\r\nIt’s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. It’s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control. Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. Highly skilled drivers control a high powered street car past its limit, sideways at high speed, burning rubber. It can’t get any better!\r\n____________________________________\r\n\r\nSUPPORT: http://en.ratrodstudio.com/support/ \r\nVISIT US: http://ratrodstudio.com\r\nFOLLOW US: twitter.com/ratrodstudio","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJ31N","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Backgammon Pro","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.57265.9007199266246025.5ad63fcf-8d02-4566-81d3-397e78178cd1.cb8fdf32-a0b7-4c60-9b49-32b1aa5b4d81","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#D19048","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.41606.9007199266246025.44ca9a04-8539-4c1e-a54c-de230319be70.458e4118-0473-4ae9-9f4b-d94a506b34b6","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#D19048","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.33872.9007199266246025.11fa2e10-ab50-4655-a5ec-4aa7d8a7115c.1c1c15f0-9855-4a14-89bd-a4a4764f8f8e","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#D19048","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.42630.9007199266246025.baf06a62-a5ad-47ce-8737-737bd4c5e268.a70dd46c-bc22-4284-952d-14344e98bff3","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#D19048","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.8,"RatingsCount":"9","PackageFamilyNames":["32988BernardoZamora.BackgammonPro_1fgex2kbsn6g8"],"ContentIds":["815ec9ff-a10d-5311-302b-07c76638f763","827ea93b-ea4c-b309-419e-0885b76c550f","12d5e003-452e-e458-57d1-90ed1c5de349"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"The #1 most downloaded Backgammon app, THANK YOU!\r\n\r\nBackgammon is a board game where two players compete to get all their 15 pieces off the board before the opponent.

It is fundamentally different from most solitaire games in that very few hands are unsolvable. Although software implementations vary, most versions label the hands with a number (derived from the random number seed used to generate the hand).\r\n\r\nA version of FreeCell was created by Microsoft for release with the Windows operating system.\r\n\r\nFreeCell solitaire is one kinds of funny solitaire card game, but it's not like other solitaires. You need no luck to win, only skill is required. All cards are opened from the start and the deal has the solution, you can win, think and move wisely. \r\n\r\nKey Features: \r\n- deals with different difficulty \r\n- every completed deal has score \r\n- customizable background and card \r\n- magnetic card movement \r\n- supermove: multiple card dragging \r\n- drag or tap to move \r\n- undo option \r\n- optimized battery usage for very long gameplay \r\n\r\nRules\r\nConstruction and layout\r\nOne standard 52-card deck is used.\r\nThere are four open cells and four open foundations. Some alternate rules use between one to ten cells.\r\nCards are dealt into eight cascades, four of which comprise seven cards and four of which comprise six. Some alternate rules will use between four to ten cascades.\r\n\r\nBuilding during play\r\nThe top card of each cascade begins a tableau.\r\nTableaux must be built down by alternating colors.\r\nFoundations are built up by suit.\r\n\r\nMoves\r\nAny cell card or top card of any cascade may be moved to build on a tableau, or moved to an empty cell, an empty cascade, or its foundation.\r\nComplete or partial tableaus may be moved to build on existing tableaus, or moved to empty cascades, by recursively placing and removing cards through intermediate locations. Computer implementations often show this motion, but players using physical decks typically move the tableau at once.\r\n\r\nVictory\r\nThe game is won after all cards are moved to their foundation piles.\r\nVarious computer versions of Freecell occasionally deal unsolvable games.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nOne of the oldest ancestors of FreeCell is Eight Off. In the June 1968 edition of Scientific American, Martin Gardner described in his \"Mathematical Games\" column a game by C. L. Baker that is similar to FreeCell, except that cards on the tableau are built by suit rather than by alternate colors. Gardner wrote, \"The game was taught to Baker by his father, who in turn learned it from an Englishman during the 1920s.\" This variant is now called Baker's Game. FreeCell's origins may date back even further to 1945 and a Scandinavian game called Napoleon in St. Helena (not the game Napoleon at St. Helena, also known as Forty Thieves).\r\n\r\nPaul Alfille changed Baker's Game by making cards build according to alternate colors, thus creating FreeCell. He implemented the first computerised version of it in the TUTOR programming language for the PLATO educational computer system in 1978. Alfille was able to display easily recognizable graphical images of playing cards on the 512 * 512 monochrome display on the PLATO systems.\r\n\r\nThis original FreeCell environment allowed games with 4–10 columns and 1–10 cells in addition to the standard 8 * 4 game. For each variant, the program stored a ranked list of the players with the longest winning streaks. There was also a tournament system that allowed people to compete to win difficult hand-picked deals. Paul Alfille describes this early FreeCell environment in more detail in an interview from 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\nSolver complexity\r\nThe FreeCell game has a constant number of cards. This implies that in constant time, a person or computer could list all of the possible moves from a given start configuration and discover a winning set of moves or, assuming the game cannot be solved, the lack thereof. To perform an interesting complexity analysis one must construct a generalized version of the FreeCell game with 4 * n cards. This generalized version of the game is NP-complete; it is unlikely that any algorithm more efficient than a brute-force search exists that can find solutions for arbitrary generalized FreeCell configurations.\r\n\r\nThere are 52! (i.e., 52 factorial), or approximately 8*1067, distinct deals. However, some games are effectively identical to others because suits assigned to cards are arbitrary or columns can be swapped. After taking these factors into account, there are approximately 1.75*1064 distinct games.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\r\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.\r\nTo make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors.
