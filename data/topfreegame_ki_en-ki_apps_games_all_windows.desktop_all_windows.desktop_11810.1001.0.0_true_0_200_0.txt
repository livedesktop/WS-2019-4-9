It is played on a square board, made of 64 smaller squares, with eight squares on each side. Each player starts with sixteen pieces: eight pawns, two knights, two bishops, two rooks, one queen and one king. The goal of the game is for each player to try and checkmate the king of the opponent. Checkmate is a threat ('check') to the opposing king which no move can stop. It ends the game.\r\nDuring the game the two opponents take turns to move one of their pieces to a different square of the board. One player ('White') has pieces of a light color; the other player ('Black') has pieces of a dark color. There are rules about how pieces move, and about taking the opponent's pieces off the board. The player with white pieces always makes the first move. Because of this, White has a small advantage, and wins more often than Black in tournament games.\r\nDeveloping Chess strategy and improving your Chess skill!

The player must rotate, move, and drop the falling Tetriminos inside the Matrix (playing field). Lines are cleared when they are filled with Blocks and have no empty spaces.\r\n\r\nAs lines are cleared, the level increases and Tetriminos fall faster, making the game progressively more challenging.

Recall your childhood!\r\n\r\nLudo game that traces its lineage to 6th century India. Ludo is derived from game Pachisi. Ludo is also very similar to Spanish board game.\r\n\r\nLudo game has stayed popular throughout the ages, varying only a little in its game structure. This persevering game is now available for you to play in an all new modernized format, i.e. as a video game application.\r\n\r\nThe game is played between 2 to 4 players and you have the option of playing the game against the computer, against your friends, or even against people from around the world. The objective of the game is pretty straightforward; each player gets 4 tokens, these tokens must make a full turn of the board and then make it to the finish line.\r\n\r\nWhoever gets all four tokens to the end first is the winner. However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided die, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a six. Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player’s token lands on the same square as your token, then your token will automatically be sent back home and you’ll need to roll a six again.\r\n\r\nLudo King is a game that was played by kings and now it can be enjoyed by you and your family and friends. While the game play might seem simple at first, the game is immensely enjoyable and challenging. You’ll be playing this one for hours and its fun for the whole family.

Our flappy friend migrated to another amusement island further in the south, where you can find the coolest mini golf tracks placed on an exotic beach.  Many trucks are littered with old clay pots that could obstruct your way.  Smash them to free your way to the hole. As the bird has a huge passion for mini golf but there are no golf clubs (sticks) and balls to play with, he has reinvented some parts of  the game concept.\r\nHe blows up his clumsy body until he looks like a ball and uses a slingshot to move towards the hole.\r\nAfter the first shot the game play will change from slingshot modus to arrow modus with a power bar, for a more precise stroke.\r\nAdvice: Remember that the first hit will be the most difficult, so do not put too much strength in it because it will simply make our fluffy friend, fly out of the track.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Awesome 3D graphics\r\n- Cute animal characters and animations\r\n- 4 amazing courses with over 70 holes\r\n- Simple, drag-and-release gameplay mechanic for the slingshot\r\n- Direction arrow with power bar for the successive par\r\n- Realistic physics and ball movement\r\n- Collectible fruit like, bananas and water melon to increase your score\r\n- Easy and funny to play\r\n\r\nTry to find the shortest and easiest path to the hole in order to rise your score. If you can make it with no more than 3 par (hits) you will get three stars.\r\nThere are also collectible bananas and Water melon slices that can increase your final score.\r\n\r\nIf you collect one water melon piece you will get back one par (hit) which means that you have higher possibilities to get 3 stars.\r\n\r\nJoin this crazy bird on his holiday at the beach and have some real fun playing this epic game.\r\n\r\nChallenge your friends and show them who the king of the trucks is!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

Meet one of the most entertaining birds on the planet.  Our flappy friend lives on an abandoned amusement island, where you can find any of the coolest mini golf tracks (courses) on earth. My bird has a huge passion for mini golf but there are no golf clubs (sticks) and balls to play with, he has reinvented the game concept.\r\nHe blows up his clumsy body until he looks like a ball and uses a slingshot to move towards the hole.\r\nAfter the first shot the game play will change from slingshot modus to arrow modus with a power bar, for a more precise stroke.\r\nAdvice: Remember that the first hit will be the most difficult, so do not put too much strength in it because it will simply make our fluffy friend, fly out of the track. Don't hit the bird into the sea - it doesn't like to be a subsurfer...\r\n\r\nCool gamefeat:\r\n- Awesome 3D graphics\r\n- Cute animal characters and animations with dancing birds\r\n- 4 fun courses with over 70 holes\r\n- Simple, drag-and-release gameplay mechanic for the slingshot\r\n- Direction arrow with power bar for the successive stroke - just touch it\r\n- Realistic physics and ball movement\r\n- Collectible coins and jewels to increase your score\r\n- Easy and funny to play\r\n\r\nTry to find the shortest and easiest path to the hole in order to rise your score. Let's make it with no more than 3 par (hits) and you will get three stars.\r\nThere are also collectible coins and jewels that can increase your final score like crazy.\r\n\r\nIf you collect one gem you will get back one par (stroke) which means that you have higher possibilities to get 3 stars.\r\n\r\nEnjoy hours of fun with this challenging free app!

Do you have what it takes to survive the online battle arena mayhem? Throw an ice bomb, dodge, travel through a wormhole, slap the guy next to you – do whatever it takes to be the last Jelly alive when the smoke settles. In the end, only the winners will be remembered!\r\n\r\nBUILD AND UPGRADE\r\nOnce you feel like adding some more fire power to your weaponry take over the Jelly Island and get your hands dirty. Gather resources, upgrade buildings, research blueprints and build even more powerful bombs to show your enemies who’s not to mess with. Keep an eye on the Island’s coastline every once in a while, though, you never know what might drift ashore from the ocean. And one more piece of advice: keep leveling up - your opponents will! \r\n\r\nENDLESS CUSTOMIZATION\r\nGetting tired on your Jelly’s looks? No problem! With over 100 items ranging from freckles to sunglasses the options to change your character's looks are almost limitless. How about a handsome fella with a goatee and a Christmas hat? No? Maybe you’d fancy pigtails with a monocle? Either way, the decision is yours to make and your opponents to bear with when they encounter your beautiful self on the battlefield.

Regardless of the number of correct answers given, and of stars earned, the child's developing skills will be fostered by enthusiastic applause and floating balloons!\r\n\r\nThis educational application contains full set of “Fruits” and “Vegetables” flashcards from the “Nature for Kids” application. In addition, it includes the clipped demo sets of the following groups of educational cards: “Berries”, “Flowers”, “Mushrooms”, “Nature” (sea, island, forest, river, mountain, etc.), “Seasons”, “Natural phenomena” (rain, rainbow, lightning, etc.).\r\n\r\nDoes the youngster have an older brother or sister in grade school? They can also use this educational game! Besides English, this app also supports the German, Russian and Ukrainian languages. \r\n\r\nWhile playing with flashcards in a foreign language, a school-age child can effortlessly learn many new words with which to surprise their foreign language teachers and classmates. An A+ is sure to follow! \r\n\r\nIn order to use this educational app, the youngster does not need to be able to read. The simple interface and spoken clues allow even the youngest of children to play and learn independently!\r\n\r\nExperience has shown that children love to look through a series of colorful pictures with sounds, and they will ask to see them again and again. According to Glenn Doman, an American physical therapist and the founder of The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential, participating in these kinds of educational activities (for 5-10 minutes a day) stimulates the development of various regions in the brain. As a result, the child's photographic memory takes shape, the child develops much faster than his or her peers, and, beginning at infancy, the child gains access to a world of encyclopedic knowledge. \r\n\r\nThe main point, in which Doman is undoubtedly correct, is that the younger a child, the more easily he or she can absorb new knowledge. It's important to make use of this ability while it's available!\r\n\r\nThe app can be used as a supplementary teaching aid in foreign language instruction. Supported languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Russian, Polish, Ukrainian.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

10!\r\n\r\nSolitaire remains the most played computer game of all time, and for good reason. Simple rules and straightforward gameplay make it easy to pick up for everyone.\r\n\r\nSolitaire has been part of Windows for more than 25 years, and the Microsoft Solitaire Collection makes it the best experience to date with five different card games in one:\r\n\r\nKlondike\r\nThis version is the timeless classic that many people just call \"Solitaire.\" Try to clear all the cards from the table using one or three-card draw, while using traditional scoring or the Vegas scoring system.\r\n\r\nSpider\r\nEight columns of cards await your attempts to clear them with the fewest moves possible. Start out playing with a single suit until you’re comfortable, and then see how you fare when using two or even all four suits in a game.\r\n\r\nFreeCell\r\nUse four extra cells to move cards around as you try to clear all cards from the table. More strategic than the Klondike version, FreeCell rewards players who think several moves ahead.\r\n\r\nTriPeaks\r\nSelect cards in a sequence, either up or down, to earn points and clear the board. How many boards can you clear before you run out of deals?\r\n\r\nPyramid\r\nPair two cards that add up to 13 in order to remove them from the board. Try to reach the top of the pyramid. See how many boards you can clear and how high you can score in this highly addictive card game!\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges\r\nPlayers receive new challenges each day. Complete enough Daily Challenges in a month to earn badges and compete with your friends.\r\n\r\nStar Club\r\nEven more challenges arranged in collections and packs you can unlock by earning stars.\r\n\r\nChoose Your Theme\r\nThe Microsoft Solitaire Collection features several beautiful themes, from the simplicity of \"Classic\" to the serenity of an Aquarium that comes to life before you while you play. You can even create custom themes from your own photos!\r\n\r\nXbox Live Integration\r\nSign in with your Microsoft account to earn achievements, compete with your friends on the leaderboards, and track your personal gameplay statistics. If you sign in with a Microsoft account, your progress is stored in the cloud so you can play the game on any device without missing a beat!\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFHZCG","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Tim the Fox","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45027.9007199266249059.073d86e5-b10a-4c4b-98ca-f7b019119b31.3d3db8e2-136c-4d4a-99d1-7eef479ed10e","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#2e7100","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38609.9007199266249059.073d86e5-b10a-4c4b-98ca-f7b019119b31.535b81d9-7ba9-4609-961f-84555fae6f14","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#2e7100","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29259.9007199266249059.3fbcef20-72f9-46aa-bacb-c2ca4a159547.a0efc128-b866-4f51-a28a-528a5744ccc0","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#2e7100","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24650.9007199266249059.073d86e5-b10a-4c4b-98ca-f7b019119b31.d4053201-15c7-4a08-bdab-8a450f19ece5","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#2e7100","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45012.9007199266249059.073d86e5-b10a-4c4b-98ca-f7b019119b31.799f309a-64a4-44a5-8f9b-8e1bf21b310c","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#2e7100","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42069.9007199266249059.073d86e5-b10a-4c4b-98ca-f7b019119b31.822edfdb-feb6-42bb-bd06-525adc33c7ec","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#2e7100","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51244.9007199266249059.410da144-c8a7-4c0d-b6eb-7fe7ac119d2d.afb6c7aa-9c2e-47e1-8dd8-f5d2e4d29fbc","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#2e7100","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37981.9007199266249059.410da144-c8a7-4c0d-b6eb-7fe7ac119d2d.4785ed43-c97f-4252-8406-84ed103a6160","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#2e7100","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51723.9007199266249059.410da144-c8a7-4c0d-b6eb-7fe7ac119d2d.c68cafad-6d99-4e68-ad0f-64f8412dea78","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#2e7100","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.44449.9007199266249059.6abee109-7e4f-4d43-b8f3-30de50f30dbf.492808cb-b64b-43dd-9a0f-600be9cfea09","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#2e7100","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["Internet-ExpertLLC.TimtheFox_s4t3paeje7va2"],"ContentIds":["dfdc03c0-c47e-e226-f264-7d43e47e33b0","1366b603-a8c8-8a35-3bcf-80831cb89ef7","b91ba3ba-4b8d-21e5-a9cf-596cf2c0d337"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Toddler teaching game \"Tim the Fox\"\r\n\r\nTim the Fox likes to play with children from 2-4 years old.

The game seamlessly combines construction management with click-and-drag Artillery style combat and strategy elements such as exploration, raiding and espionage. The game takes full advantage of stunning Unity 3D graphics to provide a visually rich experience.   \r\n\r\n[Contact Us]\r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AstroLordsWin10/\r\n\r\nYou will take on the role of an Astro Lord, leader of your own asteroids in the Oort Cloud on the fringes of the solar system. As well as vying against other players for dominance in PVP combat, you must also face off against a mysterious alien race which has invaded the Cloud.   \r\n\r\n[Game Features]\r\n---Build your  asteroids---\r\n Asteroids are at the heart of your Empire. You begin the game with a home asteroid which you must develop through the construction of facilities such as mines, power plants, factories and laboratories. Resources must be gathered, or stolen, to construct ammunition and cyborgs to fuel your expansion. Secondary asteroids can be added through colonising empty ones, or capturing developed asteroids from your enemies.   \r\n\r\n---A unique battle mode,brings you a new game experience---\r\n《Star Lord: Space Exploration》is the first MMORTS to feature moving bases on a spherical map, putting you in the driving seat. Will you manoeuvre your asteroid in pursuit of your enemies, flee from hostile foes, or explore vast nebulae and alien ruins? \r\n\r\n---Shoot!  Lead the fleet and defeat the enemy of space with allies---\r\nLeading the charge against your enemies are the Captains. You can recruit up to 6 Captains from 7 different classes. Will you recruit a Warrior and focus your efforts on combat? A Scientist, to boost your research output? A Spy, to keep tabs on other Astro Lords and alien bases? With over 50 different skills to develop, you can tailor your Captains to suit your gameplay style.
