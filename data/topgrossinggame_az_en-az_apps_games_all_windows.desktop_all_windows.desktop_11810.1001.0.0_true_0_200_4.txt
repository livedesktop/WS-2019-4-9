We specialize in educational games with the fun built right into them.\r\n\r\nLet's do the rest of the description in a question-and-answer form.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ How is the game played? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nIn the first lesson, children listen to the names of colors while a fun brush puts a big splash of the color on an easel, accompanied by an entertaining sound effect that makes the splash against the easel sound real.\r\n\r\nThen children learn how to recognize colors with a series of colorful jellyfish that float down with likable expressions on their faces. The pleasant lady announcer asks kids to choose the blue, yellow, purple, or black jellyfish. Each time children choose the correct one, she congratulates them with encouraging words like \"Perfect!\" and \"You're Good!\"\r\n\r\nNext, children discover how to build their color memories. An identical, pretty design shows up on the screen in rows. When kids tap on one of the designs, a color is revealed. Then the color disappears behind the design. Kids keep tapping until they remember where some of the colors are. Then when they tap on a design that matches one of the colors they remember the location of, they go back and tap it.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ What will my children learn? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nLike all Intellijoy games, the game focuses on a specific educational lesson, so children and their parents find the game really inviting and distraction-free.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, your child will learn:\r\n\r\n✔ The names of colors by splashing colors onto an easel.\r\n\r\n✔ How to recognize colors by being asked to do things like \"Choose the purple jellyfish.\"\r\n\r\n✔ Build memory skills by matching a color they've just seen.\r\n\r\nWe love to hear from parents – and from children, too.

Score strikes, spares, and turkeys.\r\n\r\nPICK UP SPARES\r\n\r\nPractice challenging spares. Clear stages to unlock new balls.\r\n\r\nONE HUNDRED PINS\r\n\r\nKnock down as many pins as you can in 5 throws at a rack of 100 pins!\r\n\r\nCANDLEPIN BOWLING\r\n\r\nInvented in 1880. Candlepin bowling offers a great challenge. Candlepins are thin skittles that bounce and spin unpredictably when struck. Pins aren't cleared between rounds allowing you to knock them into still upright pins.\r\n\r\nFIVE PIN BOWLING\r\n\r\n Invented in 1904 in Canada. In 5 pin, each pin is worth different point values. Spares are strategic attempts to hit the most valuable pins. A perfect game is 450 points!\r\n\r\nNINE PIN (GERMAN BOWLING)\r\n\r\nInvented in medieval Germany, 9 pin is what most later bowling games are based on. Nine pins are arranged in a diamond shape with a \"kingpin\" in the middle. Knocking all the pins over earns 9 points. Knocking all the pins over but the kingpin earns 12!\r\n\r\nLONG ALLEY SKITTLES\r\n\r\nKnock over pins by throwing a barrel-shaped 'cheese'! To score points, you first have to knock over the kingpin. It's tricky to master when the ball bounces unpredictably!\r\n\r\nDUCK PIN\r\n\r\nInvented in 1904 in New England. Duck pin uses the nearly the same rules as 10 pin, but allows 3 rounds to knock over all the pins. The ball and pins are smaller making precision very important to score well!\r\n\r\nIRON PIN\r\n\r\nIron pin is the same as normal bowling but one random pin is much heavier than the others. Careful consideration has to be made on how to knock over the heavy pin while also clearing the normal ones.\r\n\r\nSHUFFLE BOWLING\r\n\r\nBowling on a shuffleboard table! Knock over the pins with a weighted puck.\r\n\r\nWEST COUNTY SKITTLES\r\n\r\nTraditional skittles game that has been played in British pubs for centuries.\r\n\r\nGalaxy Bowling has an option to purchase Candlepin, Duck Pin, Five Pin, Nine Pin, 100 pin, and Iron Pin variants. Ten pin, and spares mode are included free.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDKPHB","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Word Unscramble for Minecraft","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31901.9007199266533983.41f9c12a-ee88-4818-9471-150cadd1a757.e3803c09-03f0-4dec-9839-712fb9e1653d","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40520.9007199266533983.0bde4f97-a0ee-46d6-b063-af9e6e59412f.beb93456-3312-485d-90ba-8957acae8503","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37889.9007199266533983.af6e7ba5-827f-47f6-89c0-56133ab903c8.d732ec8d-00e5-40d5-96e6-d8fb52e99b89","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61735.9007199266533983.a039dee7-ad4f-4ed2-9bad-3067b9a366ef.1bdaf710-960d-4fdc-95ad-2595757869e8","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["43753JohnMartello.MinecraftScramble_ca15cjppyhbny"],"ContentIds":["3f86d5d9-bfc8-6718-d299-69bb4a44dade"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Do you like Word games?

10!\r\n\r\nSolitaire remains the most played computer game of all time, and for good reason. Simple rules and straightforward gameplay make it easy to pick up for everyone.\r\n\r\nSolitaire has been part of Windows for more than 25 years, and the Microsoft Solitaire Collection makes it the best experience to date with five different card games in one:\r\n\r\nKlondike\r\nThis version is the timeless classic that many people just call \"Solitaire.\" Try to clear all the cards from the table using one or three-card draw, while using traditional scoring or the Vegas scoring system.\r\n\r\nSpider\r\nEight columns of cards await your attempts to clear them with the fewest moves possible. Start out playing with a single suit until you’re comfortable, and then see how you fare when using two or even all four suits in a game.\r\n\r\nFreeCell\r\nUse four extra cells to move cards around as you try to clear all cards from the table. More strategic than the Klondike version, FreeCell rewards players who think several moves ahead.\r\n\r\nTriPeaks\r\nSelect cards in a sequence, either up or down, to earn points and clear the board. How many boards can you clear before you run out of deals?\r\n\r\nPyramid\r\nPair two cards that add up to 13 in order to remove them from the board. Try to reach the top of the pyramid. See how many boards you can clear and how high you can score in this highly addictive card game!\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges\r\nPlayers receive new challenges each day.

Compete against players from around the world in a high speed online race.\r\n\r\nFUN DRIVING \r\nTraffic Race 3D 2 is a mixture of arcade racing and casual driving on open tracks. No more re-spawns when you hit the race track border. Go crazy and find the fastest route on each track. \r\n\r\nENDLESS RUNNER GAME MODE \r\nWe’ve invented a combination of endless running mode with a checkpoint system. You will not die because you crash, your car will take damage but just keep on going for as far as you can! \r\n\r\nGLOBAL HIGH SCORE\r\nAre you the best driver in the world? Now you can prove it! Show the world that you are the next Schumacher or Hamilton. Can you make it to 1st place in the global rank? We reset ranks every week on Mondays to keep the competition alive.  \r\n\r\nARCADE RACING PHYSICS\r\nWe’ve taken inspiration from all extreme motor sports: Nascar, F1, Le mans, Rally and then we’ve stripped it down to a casual driving experience. This lets you drift around corners at 240 km/h with your car while still having fun and do crash as often as you wish. \r\n\r\nSUITABLE FOR ALL AGES (PEGI 3)\r\nEveryone can enjoy Traffic Race 3D 2. You will actually probably become a better real driver regardless if you are an adult, teenager or child. \r\n\r\nINTUITIVE CONTROLS\r\nThe goal of this game is to make it easy and fast to run on any device (Mobile, PC, Tablet). \r\n\r\nCAMERA OF YOUR CHOICE\r\nWe’ve added the opportunity for you to switch camera mode between Chase, Helicopter or cockpit view so you really feel that you are driving a real car.  \r\n\r\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE – AI DRIVERS\r\nOur game includes AI drivers but our drivers are not perfect. They make mistakes and will not always stay on the track, probably just like you :o)\r\n\r\n100% FREE – WE PROMISE\r\nYou can unlock all cars and courses for free. You do not need to buy any smurf coins to play this game. Each time you race you gain coins to unlock cars. Courses can only be unlocked by achieving the best times on each track.  We do offer one IAP and we call it “All Inclusive”, it gives you all cars and eliminates all ads. \r\n\r\nFEEDBACK\r\nWe are listening to feedback from our users.

A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line. Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans.\r\n\r\nIt’s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. It’s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control. Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. Highly skilled drivers control a high powered street car past its limit, sideways at high speed, burning rubber. It can’t get any better!\r\n____________________________________\r\n\r\nSUPPORT: http://en.ratrodstudio.com/support/ \r\nVISIT US: http://ratrodstudio.com\r\nFOLLOW US:

Use your cunning to kill or tame the primeval creatures roaming the land, and encounter other players to survive, dominate... and escape! \r\n\r\nTAME, TRAIN, BREED & RIDE DINOSAURS, IN A LIVING ECOSYSTEM\r\nOver 50 creatures can be tamed using a challenging subdue-&-protect process. Weaken a feral creature to knock it out, and then nursing it to health. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your Pet, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Pets continue to level-up and consume food, and carry Inventory and Equipment.  Fly a Pteranodon over the mountains, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, or chase down prey on a T-Rex! Experience a dynamic ecosystem with its own predator & prey hierarchies. Breed Pets through successive generations to generate the best traits. Or put more simply, breed & raise Dino Babies!\r\n\r\nFOOD, WATER, TEMPERATURE AND WEATHER\r\nEat and drink to survive, with different foods having different nutritional values (including human meat!). All actions drain food and water, and long-distance travel is draining. Inventory weight slows you down, and the day/night cycle and weather alter the environment. Craft clothing, build shelter, and use fire to protect yourself against damage & the elements.\r\n\r\nHARVEST, CRAFT, AND PAINT ITEMS\r\nHarvest trees, ore, and more to become a master crafter. Use your hands, a Smithy, or a Fabricator to craft increasingly complex and powerful gear. Build a massive base using modular pieces--ranging from Thatch, to Wood, to Stone, to Metal. Customize your base by painting it and placing signs that you can actually draw on. Weapons, clothing, & armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.\r\n\r\nSUMMON THE ULTIMATE LIFE FORMS\r\nBring rare items to special Summon locations to awaken the ARK’s mythical creatures, who arrive ready for battle. These monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced Tribes and their Pets, and yield valuable items if they are defeated.\r\n\r\nRPG STATISTICS\r\nLevel-Up your survivor by gaining experience through in-game actions to learn new crafting Engrams, or find higher level item Blueprints in the most dangerous parts of the ARK. Customize the look of your character with a complex character creation system.\r\n\r\nHARDCORE MECHANICS\r\nItems have durability and wear out with use if not repaired. When you leave the game, your character remains “sleeping” in the persistent world. Your inventory also exists in the persistent world, vulnerable to theft. Death means permanent loss, and you can even enslave other players for your own purposes.\r\n\r\nLARGE WORLD PERSISTENCE\r\nOn the 70+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your pets stay in-game even when you leave.

Astroneer is set during the 25th century Intergalactic Age of Discovery, where Astroneers explore the frontiers of outer space, risking their lives in harsh environments to unearth rare discoveries and unlock the mysteries of the universe.\r\n\r\nOn this adventure, players can work together to build custom bases above or below ground, create vehicles to explore a vast solar system, and use terrain to create anything they can imagine. A player’s creativity and ingenuity are the key to seeking out and thriving while on exciting planetary adventures! In Astroneer you can:\r\n\r\n•Reshape the ground under your feet as though it were made of clay.\r\n•Survive on and explore carefully crafted planets that can be entirely deformed and traversed.\r\n•Snap together components and objects to build bases and vehicles.\r\n•Play with friends in 4 player online drop-in/drop-out co-op.\r\n•Discover and uncover the mysteries of the solar system\r\n\r\n•••Deform & shape everything around you•••\r\nIn Astroneer, players use their deform tool to dig, collect, shape and build anything they wish. Use this ability to dig to the center of the planet, build a ramp into the sky, or make megaliths just by using terrain! \r\n\r\n•••Explore an entire solar system•••\r\nOur vast solar system includes 7 wondrous planets that players can travel between and explore every inch of, from the entire spherical surface, through treacherous layers of caves, all the way down to mysterious the core. Each of those planets has unique and challenging surface and cave biomes that offer a multitude of challenges for players on their journey.\r\n\r\n•••Customize & build on the fly••• \r\nItems that Astroneers craft and find in the world can be snapped and connected together to create unique creations for any situation. Customize and decorate your bases, vehicles, and Astroneer.\r\n\r\n•••4 Player co-op•••\r\nAstroneer is better with friends. Group up with other players and work together to create massive industrial bases or to create fun games in the extensive creative sandbox. \r\n\r\n•••Survive & harness the power of the planets•••\r\nOnce Astroneers are ready, they may choose to attempt to understand and possibly harness the power behind mysterious structures found in the world.\r\n\r\nAstroneer began as a Game Preview title and would not be here today if not for your support, feedback, and ideas throughout that process. Now that we have hit 1.0 we will keep our pledge to continue building on the foundation that is Astroneer with free, ongoing content updates.
