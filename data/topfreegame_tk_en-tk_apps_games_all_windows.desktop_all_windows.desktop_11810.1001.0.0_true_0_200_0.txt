Land on the beach to kick the crabs back in the water and then take off quickly.  \r\nRemember to fly always within the confines of the island delimited by the beach, as the ocean is hiding a big danger.  In fact the island is permanently being controlled by a hungry shark that is always waiting for a new tasty pray.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures:\t\r\n\r\n- Easy touch and tilt control\r\n- Original 3D-run function combines jumping, turning and change of altitude (nosedive).\r\n- Colorful graphics and smooth animations\r\n- One of the coolest animal apps to play with!\r\n- The never-ending mega game\r\n- 3 different game modes: Run (normal), slow (easy), fast (hard)\r\n- Special abilities:\r\n- Lightning: Makes you fly much faster (at a nearly uncontrollable speed)\r\n- Snail: Resets your speed to normal (slows you down)\r\n- Green flare: Makes you invincible for 10 seconds (The only thing you have to remember is to turn at every corner)\r\n\r\nAdvise: Be a good vactor and catch the Snails on the ground during your rush to slow down the speed and increase the possibility of getting farther.\r\n\r\nWarning: Avoid the lightning power up that are suspended in the air, as it will give you a super turbo boost that makes you incredibly fast, but you will probably quickly lose control of the flappy bird. The only way to stop the high speed is to take a snail.\r\n\r\n3, 2, 1 go! Start your cartoon running adventure!\r\n\r\nThis is a fun and free application.

After the approval of high rise apartment building and commercial malls, the whole demographics of the town have changed. Before you would have the bowling clubs and theatre halls for the elderly, now it is more about the poker machines and pubs, not to say the brutal death racing circuit. You can understand the feelings of these retired people, after what they see their in shape of death race or even car wars not to say the roadkill.\r\n\r\nThe peaceful town is full with the noise and tyre burning after all this death race, and with the speed and intensity they drift and slip on the tracks. The locals came together for a quick meeting, they knew that the champion of the death race circuit will always have the final say about the operation of the brutal death racing circuit. So they came up with this idea, to hire a road warrior, who knows all the art of death race or car wars. They needed someone who is a master of drift or slip on these death tracks and has perfected all the skills of roadkill, by bumping hard or shooting through your turrets and missile. You can do that only if you can save yourself through your drifting skills and making the car slip from end to end. Only then you can be a road warrior and a champion of the brutal death racing circuit.\r\nSo be that death race driver for today, practice all your car wars skills, drift and slip is part of that. Bump hard or shoot, whatever is on the cards. Please come out as ultimate road warrior and a champion of the death race circuit to stop further roadkill and nasty attitude towards the elderly

Start out playing with a single suit until you’re comfortable, and then see how you fare when using two or even all four suits in a game.\r\n\r\nFreeCell\r\nUse four extra cells to move cards around as you try to clear all cards from the table. More strategic than the Klondike version, FreeCell rewards players who think several moves ahead.\r\n\r\nTriPeaks\r\nSelect cards in a sequence, either up or down, to earn points and clear the board. How many boards can you clear before you run out of deals?\r\n\r\nPyramid\r\nPair two cards that add up to 13 in order to remove them from the board. Try to reach the top of the pyramid. See how many boards you can clear and how high you can score in this highly addictive card game!\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges\r\nPlayers receive new challenges each day. Complete enough Daily Challenges in a month to earn badges and compete with your friends.\r\n\r\nStar Club\r\nEven more challenges arranged in collections and packs you can unlock by earning stars.\r\n\r\nChoose Your Theme\r\nThe Microsoft Solitaire Collection features several beautiful themes, from the simplicity of \"Classic\" to the serenity of an Aquarium that comes to life before you while you play.

Grave after grave... I couldn't bear to be a part of that anymore. The issue was so big, so consuming, and the world had forgotten about the horrors confronted on the battlefield: a child's burnt sock on the side of the road, blood spattered alleyways, the haunting stench of death and the ring of a report playing on repeat in your head as you try to sleep at night... and the look on the target's face as the blood drained from his body. But it this was war, and the law of a good soldier was a lack of feeling. Numbing my emotions and attachments to the people and places I visited was a challenge, but I soon realized the benefit... because now I was unstoppable.\r\n\r\n**** INTENSE GAME PLAY **** \r\nLaunch a fun, fast-paced 3D mobile gaming experience upon downloading this addictive FPS game.
