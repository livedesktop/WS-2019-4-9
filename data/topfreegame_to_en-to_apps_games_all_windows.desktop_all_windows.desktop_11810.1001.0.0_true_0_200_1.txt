New story filled with magic, treachery and brave feats. Are you ready? \r\nThe story of the game starts in the kingdom of old Viking king Arnar. Turns out, he was cursed by a vicious dwarf. Not just a dwarf, but Loki (the Scandinavian god of mischief) himself. The reason was simple – a precious ring. Arnar found it and refused to sell it. Many years later, the curse got through to him. This is where the action begins. Arnar gives his younger son a mission to find a dwarf and return the ring. \r\nThe Vikings sailed to the setting sun for many days, until the storm scattered their drakkar on the shores of some island. They were lucky, it was the island they were looking for. Travel with Ingolf along the picturesque lands, help the locals solve their problems, make friends with a wise Druid and, most importantly, find Loki to deliver the Viking king from the curse of the ring! \r\n\r\nJOIN US! \r\n\r\nEnjoy Realore Games at: http://www.realore.com \r\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/RealoreGame \r\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/RealoreGames \r\nPrivacy Policy: http://www.realore.com/appprivacypolicy.php","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFHMVM","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Bike Mania 2 Multiplayer","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19690.9007199266242500.ff604b1c-27b9-4808-a071-b04716808888.7266e810-6bdb-4b6c-ab15-575c0c1ab1bc","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32726.9007199266242500.a7909af7-c3be-4054-b44f-fa738d6844a8.24d23210-9ab8-4c19-8da8-a091befe7216","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49699.9007199266242500.a625c7e7-f169-4d2d-aca5-023cda6280ad.8125f78a-cea4-492b-99d2-9c78ee59e27f","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60237.9007199266242500.f21cdca3-0940-4f2d-8069-a0bfa3757020.4533901d-c57e-4281-b158-33b49dd8fdcb","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58433.9007199266242500.19f707a0-944f-4b0c-94ee-9e8c8488146a.1b0f20a7-acc5-4bf8-8074-66fc5905c4af","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51408.9007199266242500.b2812c14-2d26-45f5-ae0b-50e2245b6509.b0c373a5-8ef5-4d26-9444-2bf092dd8670","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["AceViral.comltd.BikeMania2Multiplayer_av30ceye3ja8t"],"ContentIds":["32c5218d-7ce9-fe64-2dc0-30dafbb5c1c5"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Bike Mania is back!

As well as vying against other players for dominance in PVP combat, you must also face off against a mysterious alien race which has invaded the Cloud.   \r\n\r\n[Game Features]\r\n---Build your  asteroids---\r\n Asteroids are at the heart of your Empire. You begin the game with a home asteroid which you must develop through the construction of facilities such as mines, power plants, factories and laboratories. Resources must be gathered, or stolen, to construct ammunition and cyborgs to fuel your expansion. Secondary asteroids can be added through colonising empty ones, or capturing developed asteroids from your enemies.   \r\n\r\n---A unique battle mode,brings you a new game experience---\r\n《Star Lord: Space Exploration》is the first MMORTS to feature moving bases on a spherical map, putting you in the driving seat.

With over 50 different skills to develop, you can tailor your Captains to suit your gameplay style.

This brutal running and shooting action game stars you as a sniper of a deadly operation. Trek through a devastated war torn city in pursuit of the enemy. Only once your objective has been met can you all the mission a success. \r\n\r\n****READY YOUR WEAPONS****\r\nThey would descend upon villages, bringing fire and death with them. Grave after grave... I couldn't bear to be a part of that anymore. The issue was so big, so consuming, and the world had forgotten about the horrors confronted on the battlefield: a child's burnt sock on the side of the road, blood spattered alleyways, the haunting stench of death and the ring of a report playing on repeat in your head as you try to sleep at night... and the look on the target's face as the blood drained from his body. But it this was war, and the law of a good soldier was a lack of feeling. Numbing my emotions and attachments to the people and places I visited was a challenge, but I soon realized the benefit... because now I was unstoppable.\r\n\r\n**** INTENSE GAME PLAY **** \r\nLaunch a fun, fast-paced 3D mobile gaming experience upon downloading this addictive FPS game.

Recall your childhood!\r\n\r\nLudo game that traces its lineage to 6th century India. Ludo is derived from game Pachisi. Ludo is also very similar to Spanish board game.\r\n\r\nLudo game has stayed popular throughout the ages, varying only a little in its game structure. This persevering game is now available for you to play in an all new modernized format, i.e. as a video game application.\r\n\r\nThe game is played between 2 to 4 players and you have the option of playing the game against the computer, against your friends, or even against people from around the world. The objective of the game is pretty straightforward; each player gets 4 tokens, these tokens must make a full turn of the board and then make it to the finish line.\r\n\r\nWhoever gets all four tokens to the end first is the winner. However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided die, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a six. Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player’s token lands on the same square as your token, then your token will automatically be sent back home and you’ll need to roll a six again.\r\n\r\nLudo King is a game that was played by kings and now it can be enjoyed by you and your family and friends. While the game play might seem simple at first, the game is immensely enjoyable and challenging. You’ll be playing this one for hours and its fun for the whole family. Try to beat your opponents and compete for the highest scores on the leaderboards.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N12B10QQDVB","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Bowman Master","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43139.13914045082285905.d039420c-4c1d-4354-8cce-ffc0b1b7f868.d9caac7a-4370-4f69-a85a-898d480c69a7","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41534.13914045082285905.d039420c-4c1d-4354-8cce-ffc0b1b7f868.43902295-363c-4b3b-bf71-e4339141e7b7","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["57689BIGWINStudio.Bowmasters_ksj94409qacn2"],"ContentIds":["76797cc0-2268-637f-f8dd-2620b34a63be","63bcd71f-de32-0599-77c4-625ad2d06b23"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"A brand new version of the world-famous game with bowmen - Bowman Master!\r\nAim and shoot arrows at fruits!

It is played on a square board, made of 64 smaller squares, with eight squares on each side. Each player starts with sixteen pieces: eight pawns, two knights, two bishops, two rooks, one queen and one king. The goal of the game is for each player to try and checkmate the king of the opponent. Checkmate is a threat ('check') to the opposing king which no move can stop. It ends the game.\r\nDuring the game the two opponents take turns to move one of their pieces to a different square of the board. One player ('White') has pieces of a light color; the other player ('Black') has pieces of a dark color. There are rules about how pieces move, and about taking the opponent's pieces off the board. The player with white pieces always makes the first move. Because of this, White has a small advantage, and wins more often than Black in tournament games.\r\nDeveloping Chess strategy and improving your Chess skill!

Destruction has never felt so real as you see doors and other car parts smash of your car. \r\n\r\nSome game-play tips:\r\nHave fun smashing and destroying your adversaries, but understand that the game is a quite accurate simulation of the real thing! In this derby simulator limiting car damage is key to becoming victorious and how you smash into other cars makes a big difference. Always try to smash rivals in the side of their vehicle or from the rear. Head-on collisions on the other hand should be avoided. Practice makes perfect!\r\n\r\nUpgrades:\r\nYou have various cars you can unlock. These all have the pros and cons. Be sure to upgrade your cars wisely as the various type of events require different cars. Use armor upgrades to strengthen your endurance; or engine upgrades to boost your speed. To get your upgrades you earn money during races. The better you perform the more you earn. Before a race you can also buy power-ups to boost your performance during a race. The nitro boost will allow you to accelerate super-fast and smash your opponents even harder; or choose one of the other power-ups such an armor booster to strengthen your car during the race. \r\n\r\nIf you like demolition games this game is made for you!\r\n3, 2, 1 start your download and join the ultimate demolition derby game experience now!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PNKZMQZB3B6","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"FINAL FANTASY XV WINDOWS EDITION Playable Demo","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26141.14342353077090777.1124a8e3-eca5-4fcf-8954-f1de9abe3d07.097a46ea-43c4-4cb0-85b4-56259ba33776","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32039.14342353077090777.4907acea-1c1b-446d-8fc6-b1ed6c18a765.408b0717-cbdb-4ee6-87c9-a2693e5b16b8","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63699.14342353077090777.7c48ecf1-23a0-4878-9cf6-35f4ce812f30.4aa58422-0033-4998-b414-ad2b25741603","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60640.14342353077090777.162cf0e1-1dd0-420a-a347-2fb30ce6c670.08a45f05-11f1-4e18-8dda-10e77424b206","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["39EA002F.FINALFANTASYXVWINDOWSEDITIONPlayableDemo_n746a19ndrrjg"],"ContentIds":["73eb8c7c-e164-6cff-e4d2-e96c3b8f4dfe"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Get a sneak peek into how it all starts with the demo version of FINAL FANTASY XV WINDOWS EDITION.\r\n*Spec may differ from the product version. \r\n\r\nTake the journey, now in ultimate quality.

The Tetris game was created by Alexey Pajitnov in 1984—the product of Alexey’s computer programming experience and his love of puzzles. In the decades to follow, Tetris became one of the most successful and recognizable  games, appearing on nearly every gaming platform available. This App is based on the classic Tetris, a new development in windows10!\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE\r\n\r\nThe goal of Tetris is to score as many points as possible by clearing horizontal lines of Blocks. The player must rotate, move, and drop the falling Tetriminos inside the Matrix (playing field). Lines are cleared when they are filled with Blocks and have no empty spaces.\r\n\r\nAs lines are cleared, the level increases and Tetriminos fall faster, making the game progressively more challenging. If the Blocks land above the top of the playing field, the game is over.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9MX969783VKN","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Uno Classic","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56993.13894160902856357.9e1c5cbb-c9a4-4fa0-a539-decbe20243e0.421ce040-3e88-4192-bb2b-9ac9f15a0dbc","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57706.13894160902856357.9e1c5cbb-c9a4-4fa0-a539-decbe20243e0.b0306bcd-a183-4fe5-9698-b9548517dcab","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.16998.13894160902856357.b3de4123-d4df-40bc-bd2f-e5c63350b85d.7ccac983-6f50-4258-9cab-74ccab14ddc5","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["61643PlayEverydayGames.UnoClassic_fvk8tmxh6cs7a"],"ContentIds":["e9aa04f5-f068-0fac-40c3-81f65cd4e5a5","497fc598-d9fe-3af3-cd62-94cf51c85e06"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Uno Classic is a fast and frenzied card game has been a family favorite for over four decades now.

Burst bloons on 55 all new tower defense maps or test your mastery on 13 wildly challenging original special missions. Either way, be ready to encounter all new bloon waves and special bloon attack patterns like Cash Starve or Fast and Furious.\r\n\r\nREINFORCE YOUR FRIENDS\r\nConnect with Facebook friends, then help each other win and expand. Send Supply Crates back and forth for bonus starting cash. Visit friends' cities to check out their strategies and their city design skills, and while you're there root out any bloon spies to win a reward for both you and your friend.\r\n\r\nSHOW OFF YOUR SKILLS\r\nBuild up the strongest lineup of monkey towers possible and compete with other players for the best score in weekly Contested Territory events.
