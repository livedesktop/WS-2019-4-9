It is an exciting mix of strategy, luck and skill.\r\nCanasta, and its variations, appeals to card players of all skill levels. The game play is fast and is full of exciting twists. The rules are intricate but not difficult to follow. In fact, the accuracy of play demanded by the rules adds drama to the game.\r\n\r\nCanasta in Spanish means \"Basket\".\r\n\r\nThe principal objective of canasta is to form melds - combinations of three or more cards of the same rank - with or without the help of wild cards. (Sequences are not valid melds).\r\n\r\nCanasta is a card game of the rummy family of games believed to be a variant of 500 Rum. Although many variations exist for two, three, five or six players, it is most commonly played by four in two partnerships with two standard decks of cards. Players attempt to make melds of seven cards of the same rank and \"go out\" by playing all cards in their hand.\r\n\r\nCanasta for two players is the same as four-handed Canasta, in a two player game, each player plays for himself.\r\n\r\nCanasta uses two complete decks of 52 playing cards (French Deck) plus the four Jokers. All the Jokers and twos are wild cards.\r\n\r\nThe initial dealer in canasta is chosen by any common method, although it should be remembered that there is no privilege or advantage to being the dealer. The dealer shuffles the pack, the player to the dealer's right cuts, and the dealer deals out 2 hands of 11 cards to each player.The remaining cards are left in a stack in the center of the table.\r\n\r\nThe player to the dealer's left has the first turn, and play then proceeds clockwise. A turn begins either by drawing the first card from the stock into the player's hand or by picking up the entire discard pile. If the card drawn from the stock is a red three, the player must play it immediately and draw another card.\r\n\r\nA player \"goes out\" when no cards are left after a meld or discard. A player is not permitted to go out, however, unless there's at least one canasta.\r\nIn the game of canasta a meld comprising seven or more cards, including at least four natural cards (called a \"base\"), is a canasta. The side that first reaches a total of 5,000 wins a game.\r\n\r\nDownload Canasta for Free today!\r\nYou're gonna love it!!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N7BKN3M1X8Q","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Space Shooter: Galaxy Attack","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.353.14072350008520025.47d4967f-b112-40fc-b6db-851eebfe00bb.9d08e1e1-165f-4dd4-81fb-548d99d92650","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.16162.14072350008520025.47d4967f-b112-40fc-b6db-851eebfe00bb.c88c7bf5-abf7-4456-914a-1b8907046975","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["35576LogicArcadeBattleGam.SpaceShooterGalaxyAttack_xbnay4fjvv6bp"],"ContentIds":["1c41407c-d532-ec98-8127-bdded0234594","b6cbc6ef-791d-4aa0-edf6-cff7a621ca6c"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Space Shooter - Galaxy Attack is two-dimensional fixed shooter war game. \r\nDo you want a new style of arcade shooter game?

Win against the computer or friends by place all cards in sequential order from your own pile before your opponent does.

He must play either the next card in sequential order or a wild '*' card, using either cards in hand, the top card of his stock pile, or the top card of any of his four discard piles. If the player can play all five cards from hand, he draws five more and continues playing. When no more plays are available, the player discards one card to either an empty discard pile or on top of an existing one and play passes to the next player. When a build pile reaches 12, it is removed from the board and that space becomes empty for another pile to be started; play continues until one player has played his final start card.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH42P80","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Slither.io - Snake Attack","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.11723.13510798887907827.992b7908-2e92-4eab-9e9f-55459549571f.7cf54ba8-4303-458f-bdca-7b9a5058a3d3","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8978.13510798887907827.b8a5cb17-502e-48d6-8848-c2649026cf59.621b2153-3661-41bb-a32f-36353d1e93bb","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":2.5,"RatingsCount":"2","PackageFamilyNames":["18434BoominStudios.Slither.io-SnakeAttack_a5rw1ehnj6qfc"],"ContentIds":["bf9dcbbc-1d9a-4159-0f8d-e3daba454109"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Play against other people online!

It is a two player game where playing pieces are moved according to the roll of dice, and a player wins by removing all of their pieces from the board before their opponent. Backgammon is a member of the tables family, one of the oldest classes of board games in the world.\r\nBackgammon involves a combination of strategy and luck (from rolling dice). While the dice may determine the outcome of a single game, the better player will accumulate the better record over series of many games, somewhat like poker. With each roll of the dice, players must choose from numerous options for moving their checkers and anticipate possible counter-moves by the opponent. The optional use of a doubling cube allows players to raise the stakes during the game.\r\nYou could play against the very intelligent computer or against other players.\r\nKeep playing ","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NNMLZZ3ZQ92","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Blocky Skies Craft: Crossy Heroes","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3524.13735461965171127.5beb19d0-dc7f-4648-b10e-a5a462a5789d.0ba51d4c-1882-4759-8822-63159677b060","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50872.13735461965171127.e77097f1-f52f-41c5-b8c5-09182c3f2704.16ae7119-e661-47c2-bb99-64701ad66f9a","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61771.13735461965171127.aa156319-9d5f-4ba1-8466-b5febacc0f97.5b9f58eb-2914-4060-8761-d0347128cf60","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34098.13735461965171127.1025ae63-316a-4c10-bfe1-f9cde08c663e.573a0975-a95b-43d1-b045-511aa7fe8f87","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43343.13735461965171127.0440a2ed-f301-48fa-962b-f5e4dc692b8a.39a22efb-89e7-48d2-bc36-bc68d6d68bfe","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["24CodeLimit.ShootyPixelHeroes_x6cm936q99ax2"],"ContentIds":["6cb1cab6-3358-6b1b-2d68-e8a3a0593a69","0758f9ef-9e1d-bac4-6a2b-323b2c11036c"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"¡¡Pixel Games to have fun!!\r\nThe 3D plane war in stars as become!\r\n\r\nA new version in Christmas time, crossy the skies!\r\n\r\nShooty Heroes is the more easy to play and the most fun for kids blocky game that you may find in this awesome world.\r\nONLY you may watch a video for a reward like better weapons or more coins.

It was a terrible thing that happened in Heather’s family 20 years ago. Everyone was left frantic after Heather’s sister suddenly disappeared. They started a serious investigation, looking for the young girl everywhere but it seemed that all efforts were meaningless since there wasn’t a single trace that could lead them to a certain answer of the whole situation. That’s why the police and the authorities kept the case as open but they actually gave up from it.\r\n\r\nHeather’s family is desperate all those years but they hope that one day things will change and they will see their other daughter once again. Heather on the other hand, has some strange intuition that tells her that her sister could be still alive. However, she also didn’t find any reliable trace about that, or at least until now where things started moving on all of a sudden.\r\n\r\nHeather arrives in one small city in the south part of the land. The reason for her being there is the anonymous telephone call that got last night. According that call, the answer of her big dilemma lies exactly here. Heather is looking for her younger sister for so many years. The young girl was kidnapped and from then on, no one knows anything about her. Heather didn’t like to quit all those years and even after 20 years she is prepared to take a detailed investigation, hoping that this time the mystery will be solved once for all.

The aim of the game is to get all of the cards in order (King to Ace). To win, you must remove all the cards from the table by building columns organized in descending order, from king to ace. At intermediate (2-suits) and advanced (4-suites) levels, the cards must also match suit. When you succeed in building a sequentially-ordered column, it flies off the table. If you run out of moves, click the pile at the bottom of the table to deal a new row of cards. \r\n\r\nIn our version we largely tried to recreate a full experience of that version in a tiny download package, along with multiple suite versions of the game, hints and undo (top right corner of the title bar). But there are also some minor twists to make it easier to play on a small factor mobile devices. In particular you don't have to select a card to move - drag and drop entire column - only appropriate cards will move, the rest will snap back.

This game comes from Ancient Egypt.\r\n\r\nGoal:\r\n\r\nMove all the cards to the Foundation (upper right). When the 'Easy' option is on, you only have to move all the cards on the table (tableau or pyramid) to win.\r\n\r\nRules:\r\n\r\nYou can move cards to the Foundation by Double-Tap or dropping a card on another, exposed, card. If the ranks combine to 13, both cards will move to the Foundation. Kings, being rank 13, move to the Foundation immediately upon being touched.\r\n\r\nIf you like to relax with solitaire or puzzle games then we think you'll love Pyramid Solitaire*.\r\n\r\nThe object of the game is to remove pairs of cards that add up to the total of the highest card in the deck from an arrangement of cards - a pyramid of 28 cards.\r\n\r\nWhen using the common French deck, Jacks value at 11, Queens 12, and Kings 13. So the highest value is 13. In the numbered Spanish deck the highest numbers are also the Kings at 12, so the pairs must add up to 12.\r\n\r\nTo set up the pyramid, deal one card face up at the top of the playing area, then two cards beneath and partially covering it, then three beneath them, and so on till you have dealt out a row of seven cards for a total of 28 cards dealt. Refer to image.\r\n\r\nThe remaining cards are placed to the side face down. This is the Stock.\r\n\r\nTo play, pairs of exposed cards can be removed to the Foundation if their values total 13 (12 if using the Spanish deck). Thus, kings can be removed immediately to the Foundation. Cards must not be covered. Thus when an Ace rests on a Queen, that Queen can not be removed.\r\n\r\nYou may draw cards from the Stock one at a time and match it with any exposed card. if no match is made the drawn Stock card is still discarded into the Foundation.\r\n\r\nOnce the Stock is exhausted and/or no more pairs can be made, the game ends.\r\n\r\nTo score, count the number of remaining face up cards in the pyramid. A perfect score is therefore zero, where all cards have been matched into the Foundation.\r\n\r\nConditions for winning\r\n\r\nTo be considered won, all cards (cards from the pyramid and cards from the stock) must be moved to the foundation; the game cannot be won if at least two cards cannot be moved from the stock.\r\n\r\n\r\nVariations\r\n\r\n-Relaxed Pyramid Solitaire: to be considered won, all cards from the pyramid must be moved to the foundation; the game can still be won with cards left in the stock.\r\n-Redeals may or may not be allowed.\r\nThree cards at a time from the stack, repeating until no matches can be made; placing all -cards totalling 13 in a stack.\r\n-Alternatively, seven cards are dealt below the pyramid. These cards can match each other exposed cards in the pyramid or from the stack.\r\n-Another addition is playing Pyramid Solitaire with a cell, filled either from the tableau or from the waste upcard.\r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\n\r\n+ addictive gameplay\r\n+ enchanting graphics set in Ancient Egypt\r\n+ simple controls, easy to learn\r\n+ atmospheric sound effects\r\n+ a well made free solitaire game!\r\n+ Unlimited Undo \r\n+ Detailed Statistics","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH1NVJM","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Secret of the Pendulum","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.42765.13510798885967884.e32bd86d-cc56-4126-b28e-888c1700e576.1e51ced7-edad-4ac5-b39e-7cff590990db","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#111111","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.26175.13510798885967884.ca6e783a-8802-47ca-ba9f-47518e8268a1.e04156e2-c8f1-4382-897b-3b3a682f9160","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#111111","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.32549.13510798885967884.bdadda82-dbcf-4882-8b8e-7fb0590c764f.aeb584c1-a5d9-453c-ad1f-77d2757a8133","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#111111","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.55974.13510798885967884.e4108521-85a2-475f-9079-128f4dd16140.c53d8424-b737-4c3b-b2c8-6116425afe21","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#111111","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.2,"RatingsCount":"92","PackageFamilyNames":["GamesCafe.SecretofthePendulum_s1mhxqt4xj97r"],"ContentIds":["e2f3a24d-09b1-2526-b793-c6de6fd3eac7"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Following a series of clues, join our female heroines Lily and Madison.

Backgammon is a board game in which you move the pieces around the board according to dice rolls. Once you get all the pieces in the house you take them out according to your dice. The first player to get all the pieces out wins the game.\r\nDownload and play now!\r\n\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ FEATURES ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ challenging AI\r\n\r\n✓ auto bear off\r\n\r\n✓ easy to select and move pieces\r\n\r\n✓ fluid animations \r\n\r\n✓ HD graphics\r\n\r\n✓ detailed statistics\r\n\r\n✓ nice music and sound effects\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ TIPS ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ Your pieces are white and your opponent's pieces are black. There are 24 places on the board and two places to deposit the pieces. The 24 places are represented as triangles and called points. So the 1-point is the first place where pieces can stay. \r\n\r\n✓ The points from 1 to 6 are called the opponents’ home and the points from 19 to 24 are your home on the board. The opponent needs to bring all his pieces in the home region in order to take them out and so do you.\r\n\r\n✓ You can move around the board in one direction. You move from the bottom-right corner to the bottom-left corner then to the top-left corner and finally to the top-right corner on a path that resembles a horseshoe. The points from 1 to 24 follow this path in the same direction. Your opponent moves in the opposite direction following this path. \r\n\r\n✓ The game starts with a couple of dice rolls that decide which player should begin first. The opponent rolls first, then you. The one with the biggest pips’ count on the dice starts first. A pip is a dot on the face of a dice which counts as a point of movement or placement.\r\n\r\n✓ When your turn comes you start by rolling the dice and continue by making the moves.\r\n\r\n✓ If you roll a double your pips count will be twice the pips�� sum of the dice.\r\n\r\n✓ After you roll the dice some top pieces on your triangles, will be highlighted. You can start your move with any of those highlighted pieces. To move the pieces, you select the piece by tapping on the triangle on which it lies. Then, at that point the triangle turns blue and the places to which you can move next turn green. Tap on any of those green triangles to initiate the move. When the move ends and if there are moves left on the dice new pieces will be highlighted.\r\n\r\n✓ If one of your dice is one you can move one of your pieces only one position. If the piece lies on 2-point you can move it on 3-point for example. If you roll a double, you can make four moves with the same value of the dice from that roll.\r\n\r\n✓ You can move your pieces to columns occupied by your pieces, to empty places or places in which your opponent has one piece. \r\n\r\n✓ If you move your piece over the opponent's single piece you can capture it.\r\n\r\n\r\n★ Support and Feedback\r\n\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.
