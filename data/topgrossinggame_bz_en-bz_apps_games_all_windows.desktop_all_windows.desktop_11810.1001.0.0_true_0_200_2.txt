Grave after grave... I couldn't bear to be a part of that anymore. The issue was so big, so consuming, and the world had forgotten about the horrors confronted on the battlefield: a child's burnt sock on the side of the road, blood spattered alleyways, the haunting stench of death and the ring of a report playing on repeat in your head as you try to sleep at night... and the look on the target's face as the blood drained from his body. But it this was war, and the law of a good soldier was a lack of feeling. Numbing my emotions and attachments to the people and places I visited was a challenge, but I soon realized the benefit... because now I was unstoppable.\r\n\r\n**** INTENSE GAME PLAY **** \r\nLaunch a fun, fast-paced 3D mobile gaming experience upon downloading this addictive FPS game.

scientist who predicted the fall of mankind and civilization. It doesn't know what has transpired in the wake of the fall or why the world has become so rowdy and violent, all it knows is it hasn't made an arrest in 1230 years and it's got some catching up to do. As it takes in the sheer number of people rioting the earth, the copbot's cloning activates and as he travels beyond the borders of his rebirth, his clones spawn and reign their strict laws over the town. As one of the world's last remaining superheroes, working a desk job at the local precinct, when a mob of copbots storm the district, taking out citizens left and right, he knows he must take a stand and classes from this menace. \r\n\r\nCops Vs Robbers - Survival Craft is a thrilling first person shooter adventure where you can enjoy real time battle with friends and foes from all over the globe. With over 40 weapons to create, equip and use including guns, rockets, grenades, bows, swords and gems, you'll be ready to blow past enemies with stunning finesse. Take out enemies creating or utilizing a plethora of unique strategies or even shoot through walls when you see oncoming enemies approaching on the areal entity map. Collect your daily reward by viewing short video ads, then select your difficulty level and begin fighting. In this initial map, you will be fighting against the clock in order to earn a powerful permanent weapon to carry with you throughout the game. The level will instruct you in the number of enemies you'll need to defeat and the time you'll be given to perform this feat. If you don't succeed the first time, you'll be offered another chance, or you can move on to the next level without this bonus weapon. When you reach level six you will unlock the multiplayer option.

The higher the level, the greater the reward\r\n- multilingual interface\r\n- original panoramic sound and music\r\n- additional DLC maps and campaigns with new enemies and towers\r\n- online worldwide leaderboards\r\n\r\nWe hope that Light Forces commanders, who loved the first part of Myth Defense, will be pleasantly surprised by the innovations in this part:\r\n• Enemies are now divided into classes: Live, Machine and Magic. Some towers affects only units of one class.\r\n• Moving platforms on the battlefield where you can build towers. Platform with a tower will move as close as possible to enemy units and attack them.\r\n• Some units (Dwarf and Paladin) wear armor. Armor absorbs 80% of low physical damage. Armor threshold is shown in the unit description which you can see by tapping on an enemy unit on the field. If tower causes more physical damage than the armor threshold, the armor breaks down and the unit gets full damage value. Armor doesn't protect units from other types of damage (fire , magic, etc)\r\n• Several fundamentally new towers:\r\n  - Fear Tower: scares enemy units, forcing them to run away from the tower for a while. One enemy can be scared only once (though some units are fearless).\r\n  - Cursed Tower: normally it shoots causing a base damage but can be charged with coins to temporarily multiply its power. If the health of the enemy unit does not exceed the base damage, the tower will kill it without spending extra-points. If the unit is strong tower will try to kill it, spending no more than enough extra-points.\r\n  - Jet Mace: shoots with a large spiked ball horizontally or vertically. It strikes several enemy units losing some destructive power each time. The ball continues to fly until it loses all the energy.\r\n  - Radioactive towers (Uranium and Plutonium): do not shoot, but continuously irradiates all units within damage radius. Golems and infected (by Plague or Poison Spider Tower) units are vulnerable to radiation.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDCWK8","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Hill Climb Racing","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.29247.9007199266379485.b3732cd3-fcd7-45a5-a03e-57d37e11969e.6351bc8c-bb27-4307-8cd1-008d083cc611","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#2d3133","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6397.9007199266379485.bb5c8354-1bc8-4bb4-8539-5fc4f3424669.41074328-3e79-4d4f-a9d5-e447f429cc6f","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#2d3133","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60276.9007199266379485.0129a341-a508-4be9-aebb-f759d86a5541.d581f498-93e5-4b1f-82ae-04de5add9f41","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#2d3133","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36868.9007199266379485.d3c7f55c-f663-4ffb-9a3c-beb4ebe1de51.b92881ef-dfb0-4a95-94a2-f3f0c111647f","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#2d3133","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22936.9007199266379485.50ad062c-605c-42c1-9802-2951c39ab53c.fc4b5148-3757-4a99-8a2c-e20393c9abf6","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#2d3133","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27192.9007199266379485.c1ef97c5-cf2f-4dbd-840d-c4c975f1b009.4c147b04-721a-4ac1-b7e9-151ad255f3f3","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#2d3133","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8772.9007199266379485.13de53f5-55a3-4983-a776-606abe523191.af8d658d-a984-4715-be0c-37efdb4d33f0","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#2d3133","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50933.9007199266379485.9c360531-1cd9-43ab-b713-fd0a7fd3da08.a946530a-ee74-4c27-9f70-1a5579a15e2e","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#2d3133","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63505.9007199266379485.beed6350-7db1-4828-b841-58027b3bb30d.8707f7dd-89f8-4f6b-bf5b-d28fa9e66f9c","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#2d3133","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.44972.9007199266379485.197540b8-dbff-480d-9e47-9e4d2941360f.a00c225f-5a41-4e33-a1e2-9d825f38c8a9","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#2d3133","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.3,"RatingsCount":"7","PackageFamilyNames":["Fingersoft.HillClimbRacing_r6rtpscs7gwyg"],"ContentIds":["bcc66610-5c7e-40d3-6dc6-38174f33a0d1"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"One of the most addictive and entertaining physics based driving game ever made!

This thrilling mystery merges elements of classical horror and gritty, 50’s-style noir. \r\n\r\nA paranormal private investigator is contacted by her friend, famous reporter Helen Hunter, whose voice sounds small and terrified in the voicemail. She is in the coastal town of Serpent Creek, and needs help immediately.  \r\n\r\nBut upon arriving in Serpent Creek, the detective finds no trace of Ms. Hunter. And the manager of the nearby hotel, in which she supposedly stayed, claims to have never even seen her.\r\n\r\nWeirder still is the fact the town’s streets are crawling with snakes, and the citizens seem to be sleepwalking through life. The ground shakes with violent tremors.\r\n\r\nThis case will certainly challenge the protagonist’s skills as a detective. She must save her friend, reveal the corruption and hidden agendas of the town’s citizens, and, most importantly, stop an evil plot to bring the Snake God back to our world.\r\n\r\nWhen investigating Serpent Creek, the detective will perform true investigative work: finding clues and combining them to learn the secrets of every crime scene in the all new Detective Mode! What’s more, she will crack codes, pick locks and solve clever puzzles along the way.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDG75C","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Benji Bananas Adventures","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5606.9007199266303242.7bfcaafe-4a1d-4fff-9f48-0db6166b76d8.00326f41-815a-4a23-ae88-538199ca3697","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48451.9007199266303242.12bcdb86-bbec-40df-8c31-0c488a04c89f.3e7ce117-032e-4189-8df5-c749598b1165","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42553.9007199266303242.52e68cd8-e635-44f5-a501-a594d00bd21f.b1c651bc-070e-4fcc-9304-190773bbb35d","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27666.9007199266303242.e0a0a128-76a6-4595-a1b3-402ce4e90cb0.78ee3829-167a-42b4-81a6-645280566c73","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13280.9007199266303242.35dd8043-d241-46c8-9843-28e23f7a4d17.26e1202c-e970-4e90-8648-f9b18a58e9f9","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63953.9007199266303242.f7f3e6c4-feeb-4ef6-af0b-adc29d328024.52b38806-3c62-489f-9289-42c7fa93a3d4","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9772.9007199266303242.b6b20460-c7a3-4b5d-b0cd-92c1c9d0d306.ad6c4786-c6df-4fb6-87a0-27a631aaece8","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["BenjiBananas.BenjiBananasAdventures_jk5exrty1qj4c"],"ContentIds":["81416b6b-1171-dbbd-8860-a952da9ce289","f1caeee3-0d1e-cd99-81ea-91b4cb8f917a"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"In Benji Bananas Adventures, everyone's favorite swinging monkey returns for more action in the jungle.

Starting with Windows 98 other version of solitaire joined the suit - FreeCell, Spider, Tri-Peaks and Pyramid. As a part of the standard Windows installation those games have been popularized around the world. For each of those games millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We combined all six games (Klondike, Spider, FreeCell, Tri-Peaks and two flavors of Pyramid) in a tiny download package. \r\n\r\nThe fun of original games is preserved but some improvement are made to make it easier to play on the small factor devices. In particular, you don't have to drag individual cards - drag&drop whole column, only proper cards will move the rest will snap back. The scoring all the games is simplified to track only number of moves to solve the puzzle. If you stuck, feel free to use hints or undo - implemented by all the games. Use menu (top-tight corner) to change the game type, difficulty, check score, help or to start a new game.\r\n\r\nDon't forget to check our Game section for other fun

10!\r\n\r\nSolitaire remains the most played computer game of all time, and for good reason. Simple rules and straightforward gameplay make it easy to pick up for everyone.\r\n\r\nSolitaire has been part of Windows for more than 25 years, and the Microsoft Solitaire Collection makes it the best experience to date with five different card games in one:\r\n\r\nKlondike\r\nThis version is the timeless classic that many people just call \"Solitaire.\" Try to clear all the cards from the table using one or three-card draw, while using traditional scoring or the Vegas scoring system.\r\n\r\nSpider\r\nEight columns of cards await your attempts to clear them with the fewest moves possible. Start out playing with a single suit until you’re comfortable, and then see how you fare when using two or even all four suits in a game.\r\n\r\nFreeCell\r\nUse four extra cells to move cards around as you try to clear all cards from the table. More strategic than the Klondike version, FreeCell rewards players who think several moves ahead.\r\n\r\nTriPeaks\r\nSelect cards in a sequence, either up or down, to earn points and clear the board. How many boards can you clear before you run out of deals?\r\n\r\nPyramid\r\nPair two cards that add up to 13 in order to remove them from the board. Try to reach the top of the pyramid. See how many boards you can clear and how high you can score in this highly addictive card game!\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges\r\nPlayers receive new challenges each day. Complete enough Daily Challenges in a month to earn badges and compete with your friends.\r\n\r\nStar Club\r\nEven more challenges arranged in collections and packs you can unlock by earning stars.\r\n\r\nChoose Your Theme\r\nThe Microsoft Solitaire Collection features several beautiful themes, from the simplicity of \"Classic\" to the serenity of an Aquarium that comes to life before you while you play. You can even create custom themes from your own photos!\r\n\r\nXbox Live Integration\r\nSign in with your Microsoft account to earn achievements, compete with your friends on the leaderboards, and track your personal gameplay statistics.

on the shores of a mysterious island, you must learn to survive. Use your cunning to kill or tame the primeval creatures roaming the land, and encounter other players to survive, dominate... and escape! \r\n\r\nTAME, TRAIN, BREED & RIDE DINOSAURS, IN A LIVING ECOSYSTEM\r\nOver 50 creatures can be tamed using a challenging subdue-&-protect process. Weaken a feral creature to knock it out, and then nursing it to health. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your Pet, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Pets continue to level-up and consume food, and carry Inventory and Equipment.  Fly a Pteranodon over the mountains, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, or chase down prey on a T-Rex! Experience a dynamic ecosystem with its own predator & prey hierarchies. Breed Pets through successive generations to generate the best traits. Or put more simply, breed & raise Dino Babies!\r\n\r\nFOOD, WATER, TEMPERATURE AND WEATHER\r\nEat and drink to survive, with different foods having different nutritional values (including human meat!). All actions drain food and water, and long-distance travel is draining. Inventory weight slows you down, and the day/night cycle and weather alter the environment. Craft clothing, build shelter, and use fire to protect yourself against damage & the elements.\r\n\r\nHARVEST, CRAFT, AND PAINT ITEMS\r\nHarvest trees, ore, and more to become a master crafter. Use your hands, a Smithy, or a Fabricator to craft increasingly complex and powerful gear. Build a massive base using modular pieces--ranging from Thatch, to Wood, to Stone, to Metal. Customize your base by painting it and placing signs that you can actually draw on. Weapons, clothing, & armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.\r\n\r\nSUMMON THE ULTIMATE LIFE FORMS\r\nBring rare items to special Summon locations to awaken the ARK’s mythical creatures, who arrive ready for battle. These monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced Tribes and their Pets, and yield valuable items if they are defeated.\r\n\r\nRPG STATISTICS\r\nLevel-Up your survivor by gaining experience through in-game actions to learn new crafting Engrams, or find higher level item Blueprints in the most dangerous parts of the ARK. Customize the look of your character with a complex character creation system.\r\n\r\nHARDCORE MECHANICS\r\nItems have durability and wear out with use if not repaired. When you leave the game, your character remains “sleeping” in the persistent world. Your inventory also exists in the persistent world, vulnerable to theft. Death means permanent loss, and you can even enslave other players for your own purposes.\r\n\r\nLARGE WORLD PERSISTENCE\r\nOn the 70+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your pets stay in-game even when you leave. Special themed events will occur in the world with corresponding limited-run items!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4X6T9","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Forza Horizon 3 Standard Edition","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4458.13510798887550312.1152921504704380324.3a10922a-e559-46bf-8fb4-a273279585b6","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"#FFFFFF","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15767.13510798887550312.1152921504704377460.e0e88452-19d8-488c-bd67-b1e62c14728c","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"#FFFFFF","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58425.13510798887550312.1152921504704377148.5ba983ef-4617-4dec-962c-03bd855030ba","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"#FFFFFF","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$39.99⁺","Price":39.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":[""],"ContentIds":[],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Xbox One","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"THIS IS YOUR HORIZON\r\nYou’re in charge of the Horizon Festival.

Use this ability to dig to the center of the planet, build a ramp into the sky, or make megaliths just by using terrain! \r\n\r\n•••Explore an entire solar system•••\r\nOur vast solar system includes 7 wondrous planets that players can travel between and explore every inch of, from the entire spherical surface, through treacherous layers of caves, all the way down to mysterious the core. Each of those planets has unique and challenging surface and cave biomes that offer a multitude of challenges for players on their journey.\r\n\r\n•••Customize & build on the fly••• \r\nItems that Astroneers craft and find in the world can be snapped and connected together to create unique creations for any situation. Customize and decorate your bases, vehicles, and Astroneer.\r\n\r\n•••4 Player co-op•••\r\nAstroneer is better with friends.
