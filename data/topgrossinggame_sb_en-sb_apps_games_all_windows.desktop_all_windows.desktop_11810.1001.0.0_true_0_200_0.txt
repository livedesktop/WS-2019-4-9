It is played on a square board, made of 64 smaller squares, with eight squares on each side. Each player starts with sixteen pieces: eight pawns, two knights, two bishops, two rooks, one queen and one king. The goal of the game is for each player to try and checkmate the king of the opponent. Checkmate is a threat ('check') to the opposing king which no move can stop. It ends the game.\r\nDuring the game the two opponents take turns to move one of their pieces to a different square of the board. One player ('White') has pieces of a light color; the other player ('Black') has pieces of a dark color. There are rules about how pieces move, and about taking the opponent's pieces off the board. The player with white pieces always makes the first move. Because of this, White has a small advantage, and wins more often than Black in tournament games.\r\nDeveloping Chess strategy and improving your Chess skill!

10!\r\n\r\nSolitaire remains the most played computer game of all time, and for good reason. Simple rules and straightforward gameplay make it easy to pick up for everyone.\r\n\r\nSolitaire has been part of Windows for more than 25 years, and the Microsoft Solitaire Collection makes it the best experience to date with five different card games in one:\r\n\r\nKlondike\r\nThis version is the timeless classic that many people just call \"Solitaire.\" Try to clear all the cards from the table using one or three-card draw, while using traditional scoring or the Vegas scoring system.\r\n\r\nSpider\r\nEight columns of cards await your attempts to clear them with the fewest moves possible. Start out playing with a single suit until you’re comfortable, and then see how you fare when using two or even all four suits in a game.\r\n\r\nFreeCell\r\nUse four extra cells to move cards around as you try to clear all cards from the table. More strategic than the Klondike version, FreeCell rewards players who think several moves ahead.\r\n\r\nTriPeaks\r\nSelect cards in a sequence, either up or down, to earn points and clear the board. How many boards can you clear before you run out of deals?\r\n\r\nPyramid\r\nPair two cards that add up to 13 in order to remove them from the board. Try to reach the top of the pyramid. See how many boards you can clear and how high you can score in this highly addictive card game!\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges\r\nPlayers receive new challenges each day. Complete enough Daily Challenges in a month to earn badges and compete with your friends.\r\n\r\nStar Club\r\nEven more challenges arranged in collections and packs you can unlock by earning stars.\r\n\r\nChoose Your Theme\r\nThe Microsoft Solitaire Collection features several beautiful themes, from the simplicity of \"Classic\" to the serenity of an Aquarium that comes to life before you while you play. You can even create custom themes from your own photos!\r\n\r\nXbox Live Integration\r\nSign in with your Microsoft account to earn achievements, compete with your friends on the leaderboards, and track your personal gameplay statistics. If you sign in with a Microsoft account, your progress is stored in the cloud so you can play the game on any device without missing a beat!\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJ26J","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Asphalt 8: Airborne","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54284.9007199266242715.3545cf02-997c-4195-bd5f-1f0cfecfb4e8.3c1edf53-55f4-4140-9215-8c5b776614ce","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2265.9007199266242715.3545cf02-997c-4195-bd5f-1f0cfecfb4e8.0621af45-2467-43a7-b5b2-5ffedc49a93a","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39872.9007199266242715.3545cf02-997c-4195-bd5f-1f0cfecfb4e8.3b3dceb8-d386-4a80-bd09-61149220b913","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1491.9007199266242715.3545cf02-997c-4195-bd5f-1f0cfecfb4e8.70eb6cbd-1df6-4cec-9c43-f5c2e882887a","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.16904.9007199266242715.3545cf02-997c-4195-bd5f-1f0cfecfb4e8.59806c9f-28e4-4106-8c12-0d79b9228faa","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19128.9007199266242715.3545cf02-997c-4195-bd5f-1f0cfecfb4e8.6890150a-7953-4c6c-97b5-7e456e2d4da1","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["GAMELOFTSA.Asphalt8Airborne_0pp20fcewvvtj"],"ContentIds":["8da22747-950f-85c7-ae23-5d05e473b63a"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"350 MILLION PLAYERS CAN’T BE WRONG!\r\n\r\nACCLAIMED BY PLAYERS & THE PRESS!\r\nWINNER: **2015 MWC Best Mobile Game App**\r\nWINNER: **Winner of 2014 Pocket Gamer Best Sports/Racing Game Award**\r\nPERFECT SCORE: ** 5/5 – TouchArcade**\r\nPERFECT SCORE: ** 5/5 – AppSpy**\r\nPERFECT SCORE: ** 5/5 – Slide to Play**\r\nPERFECT SCORE: ** 100/100 – GameReactor**\r\n \r\nLEAVE GRAVITY IN THE DUST!\r\n• 220+ OFFICIAL SPEED MACHINES: Ferrari, Lamborghini, McLaren, Bugatti… We got ‘em all! \r\n• STUNNING GRAPHICS: Interactions between the vehicles, environments & tracks are a fully physics-based experience! \r\n• ARCADE GAMEPLAY AT ITS FINEST: Feel the thrill of gravity-defying racing across 40+ high-speed tracks!\r\n• THE ULTIMATE MULTIPLAYER RACING EXPERIENCE: Race in real-time multiplayer action for up to 12 opponents & dare your friends to ghost races!\r\n• MASSIVE CONTENT DEPTH: 400+ career events, 1,500 car mastery challenges, 5 unique game modes.

on the shores of a mysterious island, you must learn to survive. Use your cunning to kill or tame the primeval creatures roaming the land, and encounter other players to survive, dominate... and escape! \r\n\r\nTAME, TRAIN, BREED & RIDE DINOSAURS, IN A LIVING ECOSYSTEM\r\nOver 50 creatures can be tamed using a challenging subdue-&-protect process. Weaken a feral creature to knock it out, and then nursing it to health. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your Pet, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Pets continue to level-up and consume food, and carry Inventory and Equipment.  Fly a Pteranodon over the mountains, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, or chase down prey on a T-Rex! Experience a dynamic ecosystem with its own predator & prey hierarchies. Breed Pets through successive generations to generate the best traits. Or put more simply, breed & raise Dino Babies!\r\n\r\nFOOD, WATER, TEMPERATURE AND WEATHER\r\nEat and drink to survive, with different foods having different nutritional values (including human meat!). All actions drain food and water, and long-distance travel is draining. Inventory weight slows you down, and the day/night cycle and weather alter the environment. Craft clothing, build shelter, and use fire to protect yourself against damage & the elements.\r\n\r\nHARVEST, CRAFT, AND PAINT ITEMS\r\nHarvest trees, ore, and more to become a master crafter. Use your hands, a Smithy, or a Fabricator to craft increasingly complex and powerful gear. Build a massive base using modular pieces--ranging from Thatch, to Wood, to Stone, to Metal. Customize your base by painting it and placing signs that you can actually draw on. Weapons, clothing, & armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.\r\n\r\nSUMMON THE ULTIMATE LIFE FORMS\r\nBring rare items to special Summon locations to awaken the ARK’s mythical creatures, who arrive ready for battle. These monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced Tribes and their Pets, and yield valuable items if they are defeated.\r\n\r\nRPG STATISTICS\r\nLevel-Up your survivor by gaining experience through in-game actions to learn new crafting Engrams, or find higher level item Blueprints in the most dangerous parts of the ARK. Customize the look of your character with a complex character creation system.\r\n\r\nHARDCORE MECHANICS\r\nItems have durability and wear out with use if not repaired. When you leave the game, your character remains “sleeping” in the persistent world. Your inventory also exists in the persistent world, vulnerable to theft. Death means permanent loss, and you can even enslave other players for your own purposes.\r\n\r\nLARGE WORLD PERSISTENCE\r\nOn the 70+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your pets stay in-game even when you leave. Special themed events will occur in the world with corresponding limited-run items!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4X6T9","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Forza Horizon 3 Standard Edition","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4458.13510798887550312.1152921504704380324.3a10922a-e559-46bf-8fb4-a273279585b6","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"#FFFFFF","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15767.13510798887550312.1152921504704377460.e0e88452-19d8-488c-bd67-b1e62c14728c","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"#FFFFFF","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58425.13510798887550312.1152921504704377148.5ba983ef-4617-4dec-962c-03bd855030ba","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"#FFFFFF","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$39.99⁺","Price":39.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":[""],"ContentIds":[],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Xbox One","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"THIS IS YOUR HORIZON\r\nYou’re in charge of the Horizon Festival.

Use this ability to dig to the center of the planet, build a ramp into the sky, or make megaliths just by using terrain! \r\n\r\n•••Explore an entire solar system•••\r\nOur vast solar system includes 7 wondrous planets that players can travel between and explore every inch of, from the entire spherical surface, through treacherous layers of caves, all the way down to mysterious the core. Each of those planets has unique and challenging surface and cave biomes that offer a multitude of challenges for players on their journey.\r\n\r\n•••Customize & build on the fly••• \r\nItems that Astroneers craft and find in the world can be snapped and connected together to create unique creations for any situation.
