10!\r\n\r\nSolitaire remains the most played computer game of all time, and for good reason. Simple rules and straightforward gameplay make it easy to pick up for everyone.\r\n\r\nSolitaire has been part of Windows for more than 25 years, and the Microsoft Solitaire Collection makes it the best experience to date with five different card games in one:\r\n\r\nKlondike\r\nThis version is the timeless classic that many people just call \"Solitaire.\" Try to clear all the cards from the table using one or three-card draw, while using traditional scoring or the Vegas scoring system.\r\n\r\nSpider\r\nEight columns of cards await your attempts to clear them with the fewest moves possible. Start out playing with a single suit until you’re comfortable, and then see how you fare when using two or even all four suits in a game.\r\n\r\nFreeCell\r\nUse four extra cells to move cards around as you try to clear all cards from the table. More strategic than the Klondike version, FreeCell rewards players who think several moves ahead.\r\n\r\nTriPeaks\r\nSelect cards in a sequence, either up or down, to earn points and clear the board. How many boards can you clear before you run out of deals?\r\n\r\nPyramid\r\nPair two cards that add up to 13 in order to remove them from the board. Try to reach the top of the pyramid. See how many boards you can clear and how high you can score in this highly addictive card game!\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges\r\nPlayers receive new challenges each day. Complete enough Daily Challenges in a month to earn badges and compete with your friends.\r\n\r\nStar Club\r\nEven more challenges arranged in collections and packs you can unlock by earning stars.\r\n\r\nChoose Your Theme\r\nThe Microsoft Solitaire Collection features several beautiful themes, from the simplicity of \"Classic\" to the serenity of an Aquarium that comes to life before you while you play. You can even create custom themes from your own photos!\r\n\r\nXbox Live Integration\r\nSign in with your Microsoft account to earn achievements, compete with your friends on the leaderboards, and track your personal gameplay statistics. If you sign in with a Microsoft account, your progress is stored in the cloud so you can play the game on any device without missing a beat!\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

In 1291 the Archbishop of Canterbury in England threatened clergy who continued playing Chess with a diet of bread and water.  \r\nThe game has flourished over the years and is now one of the most popular board games in the world, requiring thought, skill and strategy to become successful.\r\n\r\nThe object of Chess is to capture the opponent's King.  To capture the King you must place it in check.  If the King cannot escape by itself, or with the help of its army, it is in checkmate and the King is captured.\r\n \r\nZingMagic’s multi award winning Chess application supports over 20 levels of play allowing you to play moves or games against the clock or relax and play at your own pace. Whatever level of Chess you choose, you can be sure that ZingMagic’s Chess will give you a fun, stimulating and challenging game.\r\n\r\nThis game is ad-funded.

Its really easy to pick up and play and difficult to put down. Its simple to play but still has a strategic component to it\r\n\r\nThe objective of Uno Card Game is to empty all your cards before the other players get rid of theirs. The player reduces cards by discarding cards that match the top card in the Discard pile.\r\n\r\nUse the special action cards to frustrate your fellow players by stealing turns away from them. Match the colour or the number of the last card on the discard stack to play your cards.\r\n\r\nUno with Friends - Card Game is a very simple color and number matching game. The deck consists of 108 cards, of which there are 25 of each color (red, green, blue, and yellow), each color having two of each rank except zero. The ranks in each color are zero to nine, \"Skip\", \"Draw Two\", and \"Reverse\" (the last three being \"action cards\"). In addition, the deck contains four each of \"Wild\" and \"Wild Draw Four\" cards\r\n\r\nEach player is dealt 7 cards and the remaining cards are placed face down to form a draw pile. The first player has to match the card in the discard pile either by number or color or the player can throw down a Wild Card else he must pick a card from the draw pile. If he can play what is drawn, great. Otherwise play moves to the next person.\r\n\r\nIn Uno The card deck contains four colors with numbers from 0 to 9, as well as Action cards - \"Reverse\", \"Skip\", \"Take Two\", \"Wild\" and \"Wild Take Four\".\r\n\r\nIf you forget to say Uno, you are penalized by having to draw two more cards from the pile.\r\n\r\nUno Card Game trains concentration, memory, and reaction time.\r\n\r\nThe first one to get rid of their cards wins!\r\n\r\nDo you like playing Uno?
