of city building and tower defense awesomeness!\r\n\r\nUNIQUE SIMULATION + STRATEGY GAMING\r\nTake back the wilderness from the invading bloon hordes and pop your way from a modest settlement to a thriving metropolis. Attack bloon-infested territory adjacent to your city, win a short tower defense game, and add the captured territory to your city as a space on which to build. Buildings are the heart of your city, and each one has a specific purpose - individual monkey towers for battle, upgrades for those towers, farms and banks to drive your economy, power to supercharge your city, epic buildings for epic powers, and decorations to make your city more awesome. Every time you build, your city looks cooler, you increase your power potential in tower defense play, and you open up even more rewards and challenges.\r\n\r\nAMAZING DEPTH AND VARIETY\r\nAll 21 of the fully awesomized and carefully balanced Bloons TD 5 towers are available within Monkey City, with completely new unlock mechanics. More than 130 buildings and decorations give you endless strategies and city design options. Explore the wilderness to find treasure tiles and uncover 11 powerful special items like the Banana Replicator and the Dark Temple Idol. Burst bloons on 55 all new tower defense maps or test your mastery on 13 wildly challenging original special missions. Either way, be ready to encounter all new bloon waves and special bloon attack patterns like Cash Starve or Fast and Furious.\r\n\r\nREINFORCE YOUR FRIENDS\r\nConnect with Facebook friends, then help each other win and expand. Send Supply Crates back and forth for bonus starting cash. Visit friends' cities to check out their strategies and their city design skills, and while you're there root out any bloon spies to win a reward for both you and your friend.\r\n\r\nSHOW OFF YOUR SKILLS\r\nBuild up the strongest lineup of monkey towers possible and compete with other players for the best score in weekly Contested Territory events. Use the latest in monkey science to send player vs. player bloon attacks, then see whose defenses are the strongest and earn extra rewards for victory.\r\n\r\nDownload for free and play Bloons Monkey City now!\r\n\r\nPlease Note:\r\nBloons Monkey City is free to download and play (aside from internet, carrier, data, device, and other services for which the player is financially responsible), but some in-game items can be purchased with real money. You can turn off the payment feature by disabling in-app purchases in your device's settings, or reach us at support@ninjakiwi.com for help.

You can either play the easy Draw 1 games where most games are winnable, or if you feel up-to the challenge, try your luck with Draw 3 and Vegas play modes.\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy adding a personal touch to your game, customize the backdrop and card backs with photos from your own photo library for unlimited personalization possibilities. \r\n\r\nKey Features: \r\n+ Draw 1 card (Easy) \r\n+ Draw 3 cards (Hard) \r\n+ 10 Kinds of App Backgrounds \r\n+ 14 Kinds of Card Backgrounds \r\n+ Crisp, beautiful, and easy to read cards \r\n+ Portrait or landscape \r\n+ Efficient, fast, and sensible game interface \r\n+ Single tap to place a card or drag and drop \r\n+ Standard Klondike scoring \r\n+ Smart hints show potentially useful moves \r\n+ Custom backdrops & cards from your photos \r\n+ Timer, moves, and statistics \r\n+ Unlimited Undos \r\n+ Auto-Complete option to finish a solved game \r\n+ Fun & challenging achievements \r\n\r\nRules:\r\n\r\nTaking a shuffled standard 52-card deck of playing cards (without Jokers), one upturned card is dealt on the left of the playing area, then six downturned cards (from left to right). On top of the downturned cards, an upturned card is dealt on the left-most downturned pile, and downturned cards on the rest until all piles have an upturned card. The piles should look like the figure to the right.\r\n\r\nThe four foundations (light rectangles in the upper right of the figure) are built up by suit from Ace (low in this game) to King, and the tableau piles can be built down by alternate colors, and partial or complete piles can be moved if they are built down by alternate colors also. Any empty piles can be filled with a King or a pile of cards with a King. The aim of the game is to build up a stack of cards starting with 2 and ending with King, all of the same suit. Once this is accomplished, the goal is to move this to a foundation, where the player has previously placed the Ace of that suit. Once the player has done this, they will have \"finished\" that suit, the goal being, of course, to finish all suits, at which time the player would have won. There are different ways of dealing the remainder of the deck:\r\n\r\nTurning three cards at once to the waste, either allowing three passes through the deck or placing no limit on passes through the deck.\r\nTurning three cards at once, reversing the order of each group of three as the cards are dealt.\r\nTurning only one card at a time, but only passing through the deck once.\r\nTurning only one card at a time, but placing no limit on passes through the deck.\r\nTurning three cards at once to the waste with no limit on passes through the deck, but allowing the player to switch once to a single pass through the deck one card at a time; after that single pass, however, the player cannot go back to turning three cards at a time and can turn over no more cards from the waste.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDCWK8","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Hill Climb Racing","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.29247.9007199266379485.b3732cd3-fcd7-45a5-a03e-57d37e11969e.6351bc8c-bb27-4307-8cd1-008d083cc611","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#2d3133","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6397.9007199266379485.bb5c8354-1bc8-4bb4-8539-5fc4f3424669.41074328-3e79-4d4f-a9d5-e447f429cc6f","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#2d3133","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60276.9007199266379485.0129a341-a508-4be9-aebb-f759d86a5541.d581f498-93e5-4b1f-82ae-04de5add9f41","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#2d3133","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36868.9007199266379485.d3c7f55c-f663-4ffb-9a3c-beb4ebe1de51.b92881ef-dfb0-4a95-94a2-f3f0c111647f","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#2d3133","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22936.9007199266379485.50ad062c-605c-42c1-9802-2951c39ab53c.fc4b5148-3757-4a99-8a2c-e20393c9abf6","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#2d3133","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27192.9007199266379485.c1ef97c5-cf2f-4dbd-840d-c4c975f1b009.4c147b04-721a-4ac1-b7e9-151ad255f3f3","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#2d3133","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8772.9007199266379485.13de53f5-55a3-4983-a776-606abe523191.af8d658d-a984-4715-be0c-37efdb4d33f0","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#2d3133","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50933.9007199266379485.9c360531-1cd9-43ab-b713-fd0a7fd3da08.a946530a-ee74-4c27-9f70-1a5579a15e2e","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#2d3133","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63505.9007199266379485.beed6350-7db1-4828-b841-58027b3bb30d.8707f7dd-89f8-4f6b-bf5b-d28fa9e66f9c","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#2d3133","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.44972.9007199266379485.197540b8-dbff-480d-9e47-9e4d2941360f.a00c225f-5a41-4e33-a1e2-9d825f38c8a9","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#2d3133","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.9,"RatingsCount":"116","PackageFamilyNames":["Fingersoft.HillClimbRacing_r6rtpscs7gwyg"],"ContentIds":["bcc66610-5c7e-40d3-6dc6-38174f33a0d1"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"One of the most addictive and entertaining physics based driving game ever made!

They prosper and reach their milestones that way. One heroic hamster tired of idleness decided there is more to life and idle than just that. Instead of going through the idle games routine of an ordinary rodent, he tapped and gathered like-minded hamsters for a trip of their lifetimes to reach his milestones - gather energy riches. He took some picks and built a high-tech spaceship powered by his tapped click wheel and prepared for a journey to explore the vast riches of the outer space void. All he needs before the takeoff to the void is your click.\r\n\r\nYour duty and milestones in this incremental game are to make sure that the brave heroic hamster picks do not revert to his idling ways and the eager astronaut would prosper by tapping him or his wheel with power click encouraging him to generate energy riches milestones and delve ever deeper into unexplored universe void. \r\n\r\nIn Hamster Universe like in idle games you have to spend the click generated energy for items of clothing appropriate for a heroic space voyager this eager hamster is (after all, you don’t want the first space hamster traveling dressed in some old rags, do you?). While the amount of tapped energy the astronaut hamster can generate by running is truly astounding, you can add to it by spending a part of the energy yield on alternate sources of picks which will keep the energy flowing even when the eager hamster picks are resting. If you want to generate even more, the hamster will always have some rewarding tasks and milestones to do. Fulfill them and you shall see the energy level riches skyrocket and your little astronaut hamster prosper.\r\n\r\nThe thought of idleness flying through the incremental / idle space with nothing but void around makes you feel uncomfortable? Don't worry! You shall not be joining a crew of a single spaceship. In fact, your eager tapped friend picks a whole fleet of heroic hamster-piloted spacecraft in support!\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n• Idle games / Incremental gameplay is easy to understand for everyone!

Jelly is one of those games where you think you'll just play one quick round and then you don't stop playing for hours. Like the other Match-3 games, you have to make groups of three out of the jellies which then dissolve, making room for new pieces. If you're lucky, the new pieces match the existing ones, setting off a chain reaction and suddenly racking up your points. If you combine more than three jellies of the same colour, they leave behind a bonus block that makes a whole row or colour vanish in seconds.

Grave after grave... I couldn't bear to be a part of that anymore. The issue was so big, so consuming, and the world had forgotten about the horrors confronted on the battlefield: a child's burnt sock on the side of the road, blood spattered alleyways, the haunting stench of death and the ring of a report playing on repeat in your head as you try to sleep at night... and the look on the target's face as the blood drained from his body. But it this was war, and the law of a good soldier was a lack of feeling. Numbing my emotions and attachments to the people and places I visited was a challenge, but I soon realized the benefit... because now I was unstoppable.\r\n\r\n**** INTENSE GAME PLAY **** \r\nLaunch a fun, fast-paced 3D mobile gaming experience upon downloading this addictive FPS game.
