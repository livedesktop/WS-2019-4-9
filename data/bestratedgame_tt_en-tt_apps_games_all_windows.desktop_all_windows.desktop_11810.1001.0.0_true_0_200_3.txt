Your kids can hand Tommy a skateboard to make him go faster as they become comfortable with blending the sounds.\r\n\r\n- With Skateboards and Helmets children practice reading as they are asked to fit Tommy's animal friends with skateboards and helmets.\r\n\r\n- In Turn the Blocks kids make words in a way that's fun by turning real-looking blocks with letters on each side until the word is spelled out.\r\n\r\n- Through Word Ball children learn to identify spoken words by helping Tommy bat the right ball.\r\n\r\n- With Word Magic kids learn about word families as they fill the corresponding pot with potion and watch magic happen\r\n\r\n- In Rocket Words children get to practice word families as they assemble and launch a rocket into space\r\n\r\nIf your children do not know the alphabet sounds yet, we recommend our Kids ABC Phonics app. And if your kids need to learn or practice the names of the letters, try our Kids ABC Letters app.\r\n\r\nEvery section is designed to let children enjoy success time after time and receive positive reinforcement from the likable teacher, so they want to keep learning. Once your child is involved and happy, you can relax, with the assurance that he or she is having a great time - and learning.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJ258","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Don't Tap the White Tiles","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.35200.9007199266242737.e19d1254-7827-410b-aca3-ea7a8d5dde2f.2a24269d-8853-4f26-9282-9028c653b731","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.21228.9007199266242737.70f25b8e-aa93-4891-8ba6-1ec775c4e8ec.f4ba623c-b5b5-4db3-9940-8991659f5f46","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.0,"RatingsCount":"2","PackageFamilyNames":["54967SteelApps.DontTaptheWhiteTiles_mshh1qpetf232"],"ContentIds":["423bf601-b818-0648-b753-2e48d0a059df","ccf3d27e-f2d7-ee85-dd39-851162660b13"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"250,000+ downloads.

Be the firefighter & rescue services guy and save lives. You need to drive the fire truck in a big urban city and respond to emergency situations. Use the water gun to put out the fire. The fire brigade department also runs a first aid unit. Drive the ambulance in the city and reach the emergency scene quickly to make sure the injured people get medical attention. It is an emergency rescue simulation game so you can think of yourself as a firefighter from fdny or a fire fighter from San Francisco fire department. Just make sure you drive carefully and don’t bump into traffic and fixtures as it will only add delays and injured people are depending upon you. The fire truck and ambulance are ready for firefighting and rescue duty.\r\n\r\nDrive rescue and emergency vehicles in the urban city. Fire extinguishing can be tricky so make sure you throw the water with pressure and keep the direction of the water gun steady. Keep the fire truck emergency siren on and speed away. Rush towards the emergency scene to save the day and be the superhero fireman. Use your water gun to put the fire out sensibly as you will also have to collect water from multiple points to fill up the fire truck. Since it is a big urban city, there can be various fires and emergency situations. A fire in a high rise building, an air plane landing gear on fire, fire caused due to a traffic accident – all these emergency situations can arise in a big urban city and it is your duty to make sure you respond to all these emergency situations by driving the fire truck in time for rescue.\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH67NVD","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Real Archery King : Bow Arrow Hunting","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50911.13510798886649815.4f5e3973-159c-4799-9acc-c62b8a4ea879.f6e71d69-bb6b-48e4-a864-2590c3f54a42","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12935.13510798886649815.15744d15-379c-4336-ab6a-19b6ade52cca.2f328fa6-7c5f-4e4b-b4df-645ef7c66756","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15412.13510798886649815.03404f03-8503-414e-a4b4-f126a5f827d1.519c54cb-db1e-4f2e-adeb-c4089fd1c1d5","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["AbsoLogixTechnologiesLimi.RealArcheryKingBowArrowH_bqy72ee6esnst"],"ContentIds":["7b5cf6b8-ad4c-de99-eddb-f5fa4ddf1a6a"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"*****Discover top free archery challenging game, experience the real archery shooting combat and challenge the world with your great precision*****\r\n\r\nOne of the World # 1 3d archery challenging games is now on windows store.

No more re-spawns when you hit the race track border. Go crazy and find the fastest route on each track. \r\n\r\nENDLESS RUNNER GAME MODE \r\nWe’ve invented a combination of endless running mode with a checkpoint system. You will not die because you crash, your car will take damage but just keep on going for as far as you can! \r\n\r\nGLOBAL HIGH SCORE\r\nAre you the best driver in the world? Now you can prove it! Show the world that you are the next Schumacher or Hamilton. Can you make it to 1st place in the global rank? We reset ranks every week on Mondays to keep the competition alive.  \r\n\r\nARCADE RACING PHYSICS\r\nWe’ve taken inspiration from all extreme motor sports: Nascar, F1, Le mans, Rally and then we’ve stripped it down to a casual driving experience. This lets you drift around corners at 240 km/h with your car while still having fun and do crash as often as you wish. \r\n\r\nSUITABLE FOR ALL AGES (PEGI 3)\r\nEveryone can enjoy Traffic Race 3D 2.

They make mistakes and will not always stay on the track, probably just like you :o)\r\n\r\n100% FREE – WE PROMISE\r\nYou can unlock all cars and courses for free. You do not need to buy any smurf coins to play this game. Each time you race you gain coins to unlock cars. Courses can only be unlocked by achieving the best times on each track.  We do offer one IAP and we call it “All Inclusive”, it gives you all cars and eliminates all ads. \r\n\r\nFEEDBACK\r\nWe are listening to feedback from our users.

Recall your childhood!\r\n\r\nLudo game that traces its lineage to 6th century India. Ludo is derived from game Pachisi. Ludo is also very similar to Spanish board game.\r\n\r\nLudo game has stayed popular throughout the ages, varying only a little in its game structure. This persevering game is now available for you to play in an all new modernized format, i.e. as a video game application.\r\n\r\nThe game is played between 2 to 4 players and you have the option of playing the game against the computer, against your friends, or even against people from around the world. The objective of the game is pretty straightforward; each player gets 4 tokens, these tokens must make a full turn of the board and then make it to the finish line.\r\n\r\nWhoever gets all four tokens to the end first is the winner. However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided die, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a six. Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player’s token lands on the same square as your token, then your token will automatically be sent back home and you’ll need to roll a six again.\r\n\r\nLudo King is a game that was played by kings and now it can be enjoyed by you and your family and friends. While the game play might seem simple at first, the game is immensely enjoyable and challenging. You’ll be playing this one for hours and its fun for the whole family. Try to beat your opponents and compete for the highest scores on the leaderboards.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH5L7KS","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Slot Machine Pro 2016","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52144.13510798887173493.7a68e116-0bf0-452c-a192-d337650924b6.8bc38603-d7b4-4c7b-8880-9b1dd2fc6831","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53937.13510798887173493.a0cd6040-dbd4-431b-9d69-839f2c7d16ed.79b730b5-2176-4592-b18f-aeda25e608b0","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.0,"RatingsCount":"2","PackageFamilyNames":["40588MidwayStudios.SlotMachinePro2016_svrvwanpjnagm"],"ContentIds":["54ef0de7-2661-e3ed-d316-7ed9bb09a769"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Play free Slot Machine Pro 2016 with Wilds, Free Spins and Bonus games, just like casino slots in Vegas.
