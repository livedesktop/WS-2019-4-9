of city building and tower defense awesomeness!\r\n\r\nUNIQUE SIMULATION + STRATEGY GAMING\r\nTake back the wilderness from the invading bloon hordes and pop your way from a modest settlement to a thriving metropolis. Attack bloon-infested territory adjacent to your city, win a short tower defense game, and add the captured territory to your city as a space on which to build. Buildings are the heart of your city, and each one has a specific purpose - individual monkey towers for battle, upgrades for those towers, farms and banks to drive your economy, power to supercharge your city, epic buildings for epic powers, and decorations to make your city more awesome. Every time you build, your city looks cooler, you increase your power potential in tower defense play, and you open up even more rewards and challenges.\r\n\r\nAMAZING DEPTH AND VARIETY\r\nAll 21 of the fully awesomized and carefully balanced Bloons TD 5 towers are available within Monkey City, with completely new unlock mechanics. More than 130 buildings and decorations give you endless strategies and city design options. Explore the wilderness to find treasure tiles and uncover 11 powerful special items like the Banana Replicator and the Dark Temple Idol. Burst bloons on 55 all new tower defense maps or test your mastery on 13 wildly challenging original special missions. Either way, be ready to encounter all new bloon waves and special bloon attack patterns like Cash Starve or Fast and Furious.\r\n\r\nREINFORCE YOUR FRIENDS\r\nConnect with Facebook friends, then help each other win and expand. Send Supply Crates back and forth for bonus starting cash. Visit friends' cities to check out their strategies and their city design skills, and while you're there root out any bloon spies to win a reward for both you and your friend.\r\n\r\nSHOW OFF YOUR SKILLS\r\nBuild up the strongest lineup of monkey towers possible and compete with other players for the best score in weekly Contested Territory events. Use the latest in monkey science to send player vs. player bloon attacks, then see whose defenses are the strongest and earn extra rewards for victory.\r\n\r\nDownload for free and play Bloons Monkey City now!\r\n\r\nPlease Note:\r\nBloons Monkey City is free to download and play (aside from internet, carrier, data, device, and other services for which the player is financially responsible), but some in-game items can be purchased with real money.

It has 2500 levels you can win. Play this game 10 minutes per day and you will still need 2+ years to complete all levels. Compete with people around the world and be the first to complete all 2500 levels. You start with levels in which you draw 1 card. But as you progress the levels will become more challenging and you will get more and more levels in which you draw 3 cards. Ready for this epic challenge?

You can also drag & drop to move cards;\r\n♠ Natural animations, relaxing graphics and a very intuitive interface;\r\n\r\n♦♦ HOW TO PLAY ♦♦\r\n\r\n♣ In this game you have to build up 4 stacks of cards of the same suit in each of the 4 foundation piles from the top of the screen. Each of the foundation piles must start with an ace and end with a king.\r\n♣ The cards from the 7 columns can be placed in descending order by alternating between red (hearts and diamonds) and black (spades and clubs). For example, you can place a 5 of hearts on a 6 of spades. \r\n♣ You are allowed to move runs of cards between columns. A run is a set of cards with numbers in a descending order and alternating colors.\r\n♣ If you ever get empty columns you can place a king or any run starting with a king.\r\n♣ When you run out of useful moves you can continue by tapping on the deck at the top left of the screen. You will draw 1 card or 3 cards depending on the type of the level. If there are no more cards in the deck tap on its outline to draw more cards from the beginning.\r\n♣ You should try to expose more and more cards as quickly as possible. Important cards might be buried under other cards.\r\n\r\n\r\n♥♥ Support and Feedback\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

This old school game is simply phenomenal! ... a lot like \"Super Mario Bros.\" ( or „Sonic“ / „Rayman“)! So, get in on the fun! \r\n\r\nBe nimble... be quick... and help Lep find his gold. It's hidden in a range of awesomely well-designed levels, and he's determined to find it all!\r\n\r\n5/5 - \"The best game ever! I love it so much, I can't stop playing it!\"\r\n5/5 - \"It's a lot of fun, regardless of your age!\"\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: Lep's World is completely free to play, but there may be some in-game items that you can purchase. If you don't want to use this feature, simply disable the in-app purchase in your device settings mode.\r\n\r\nLep's World features:\r\n+ 112 well-designed levels \r\n+ Fabulous animations and in-game graphics \r\n+ 6 different world themes\r\n+ 9 challenging enemies\r\n\r\nLep the leprechaun has lost his gold, so to find it he needs you to help him run and jump through the fantastical realms of Lep's World. Be careful, though. This place is full of beastly monsters, and they'll do everything they can to stop little Lep. If you collect a cloverleaf, Lep's health grows. Ah, but health alone won't keep Lep out of trouble. Even an angry bee could sting him! Use your smooth, easy moves to guide Lep on his adventure. It's \"forty shades o' fun\"!\r\n\r\nNeed technical support? Want to send us suggestions?
