Recall your childhood!\r\n\r\nLudo game that traces its lineage to 6th century India. Ludo is derived from game Pachisi. Ludo is also very similar to Spanish board game.\r\n\r\nLudo game has stayed popular throughout the ages, varying only a little in its game structure. This persevering game is now available for you to play in an all new modernized format, i.e. as a video game application.\r\n\r\nThe game is played between 2 to 4 players and you have the option of playing the game against the computer, against your friends, or even against people from around the world. The objective of the game is pretty straightforward; each player gets 4 tokens, these tokens must make a full turn of the board and then make it to the finish line.\r\n\r\nWhoever gets all four tokens to the end first is the winner. However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided die, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a six. Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player’s token lands on the same square as your token, then your token will automatically be sent back home and you’ll need to roll a six again.\r\n\r\nLudo King is a game that was played by kings and now it can be enjoyed by you and your family and friends. While the game play might seem simple at first, the game is immensely enjoyable and challenging. You’ll be playing this one for hours and its fun for the whole family. Try to beat your opponents and compete for the highest scores on the leaderboards.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

Drag guards into the shadow\r\nTo avoid any later detection of knocked out guards you need to be sure to drag them out of sight into a dark corner or behind cover. Detection of a guards leads to the alarm being raised and will negatively impact your stealth % score.\r\n4.

This is not a game. You are controlling flying rc models that reacts like real flying models. It takes some time to learn, and again, do not expect \"arcade\" style controls. \r\n2. The onscreen control sticks are just indicators! They are made small so they do not obscure the screen. \r\n\r\n*** You do not need to keep your fingers on them *** \r\n\r\nSliding your finger any where on the right screen half affects the right control stick , the same for the left screen part - sliding finger there moves the left control stick. \r\n\r\nWe suggest to select beginner settings at first few days before you can comfortably progress further.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDLF69","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"4 Pics 1 Word","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55830.9007199266416358.38882160-54db-4ca4-99fa-b03d1c7458d9.d95ae0ec-72b4-4f6c-83bc-68a42decaef4","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.16080.9007199266416358.072a8c9d-446c-438b-926d-c578083f14fc.b2acb80e-b0e3-4843-b291-3a305ae3b57a","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47587.9007199266416358.c0a3ec03-a2d9-441a-aaad-638dab868ee3.bc00a6d3-f3b2-4ae4-8cdd-3dfffe1ddbf3","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5027.9007199266416358.a89a6ad4-a073-4e56-b06c-69296f11ed3e.6e1ca5b2-30eb-4b25-8750-b4138e56476b","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59521.9007199266416358.64d4e447-1f71-4492-af7d-05002cd53b9a.5e50157d-3a53-490a-a81d-cf892f097260","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6468.9007199266416358.061dee4a-dbc7-49f6-92bb-220cd7c48a87.bca34fc4-69d3-4c15-bf15-9daa234a7742","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["LOTUMGmbH.4Pics1Word_d27bk5xmx6h7r"],"ContentIds":["54f03e38-c9bf-5565-851f-d71d9a6bc3ba"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"THE #1 HIT WITH OVER 100,000,000 PLAYERS WORLDWIDE!\r\n★★★★FINALLY AVAILABLE FOR WINDOWS 8!★★★★\r\nFour pictures that have one word in common – what is it?\r\nFind out why everyone loves this game and JOIN THE FUN NOW!\r\n \r\n★ENDLESS FUN WITH NEW PUZZLES!★\r\nCan you guess the words and unlock the levels?

This fast- paced, addictive game is a great pastime fun for all those of you out there with competitive spirit.\r\n\r\nMatch Fast is a simple game, yet not so easy to play. Gather your friends and begin a matching competition to establish whose observation and matching skills rock. Challenge someone to a duel, or attempt a multiplayer match and stay on the roll until one of you scores 10. But, be careful! Every correct match brings a point, but every incorrect one takes a point away. So, sharpen your sight and dive into the world of stars, candy and fruits. \r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n✔\t3 different modes of playing: 2, 3 or 4 players\r\n✔\tthe goal is to score 10 points\r\n✔\tcorrect matches bring +1 point, but the incorrect ones bring -1 point\r\n✔\tdifferent symbols involving hearts, stars, candy and fruit\r\n✔\tthe game is suitable for small kids, teens and adults\r\n✔\tthe game develops mental processing and quick thinking skills in an amusing way\r\n✔\tit is translated into more than 15 languages\r\n\r\nThis game is very entertaining and unlike single player games, it encourages social skills as at least two players are necessary to play the game.
