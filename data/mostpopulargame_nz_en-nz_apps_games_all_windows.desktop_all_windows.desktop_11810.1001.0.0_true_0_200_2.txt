You can either play the easy Draw 1 games where most games are winnable, or if you feel up-to the challenge, try your luck with Draw 3 and Vegas play modes.\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy adding a personal touch to your game, customize the backdrop and card backs with photos from your own photo library for unlimited personalization possibilities. \r\n\r\nKey Features: \r\n+ Draw 1 card (Easy) \r\n+ Draw 3 cards (Hard) \r\n+ 10 Kinds of App Backgrounds \r\n+ 14 Kinds of Card Backgrounds \r\n+ Crisp, beautiful, and easy to read cards \r\n+ Portrait or landscape \r\n+ Efficient, fast, and sensible game interface \r\n+ Single tap to place a card or drag and drop \r\n+ Standard Klondike scoring \r\n+ Smart hints show potentially useful moves \r\n+ Custom backdrops & cards from your photos \r\n+ Timer, moves, and statistics \r\n+ Unlimited Undos \r\n+ Auto-Complete option to finish a solved game \r\n+ Fun & challenging achievements \r\n\r\nRules:\r\n\r\nTaking a shuffled standard 52-card deck of playing cards (without Jokers), one upturned card is dealt on the left of the playing area, then six downturned cards (from left to right). On top of the downturned cards, an upturned card is dealt on the left-most downturned pile, and downturned cards on the rest until all piles have an upturned card. The piles should look like the figure to the right.\r\n\r\nThe four foundations (light rectangles in the upper right of the figure) are built up by suit from Ace (low in this game) to King, and the tableau piles can be built down by alternate colors, and partial or complete piles can be moved if they are built down by alternate colors also. Any empty piles can be filled with a King or a pile of cards with a King. The aim of the game is to build up a stack of cards starting with 2 and ending with King, all of the same suit. Once this is accomplished, the goal is to move this to a foundation, where the player has previously placed the Ace of that suit. Once the player has done this, they will have \"finished\" that suit, the goal being, of course, to finish all suits, at which time the player would have won. There are different ways of dealing the remainder of the deck:\r\n\r\nTurning three cards at once to the waste, either allowing three passes through the deck or placing no limit on passes through the deck.\r\nTurning three cards at once, reversing the order of each group of three as the cards are dealt.\r\nTurning only one card at a time, but only passing through the deck once.\r\nTurning only one card at a time, but placing no limit on passes through the deck.\r\nTurning three cards at once to the waste with no limit on passes through the deck, but allowing the player to switch once to a single pass through the deck one card at a time; after that single pass, however, the player cannot go back to turning three cards at a time and can turn over no more cards from the waste.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9P0SB8KBNRXR","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Toy Paradise","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51208.14525136958797436.7eb2d3ce-8be2-4c88-a34b-f1458cbd73b3.85b85d18-7c7c-4503-9714-5adeac50206a","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14274.14525136958797436.7eb2d3ce-8be2-4c88-a34b-f1458cbd73b3.b8dabb7f-6d98-4665-abac-04de75a7552a","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9572.14525136958797436.7eb2d3ce-8be2-4c88-a34b-f1458cbd73b3.4fff5475-87c9-4937-a6d4-ac4c43bf48d3","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["55026QueenGames.ToyBlastOfficialGame_fd557p673vg74"],"ContentIds":["5036cadb-e10f-a5aa-d68a-27a9d0c2a7e2","f7fce511-33b2-a410-3188-88d8edd69da4"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"IT’S TOY BLAST TIME!

variation of popular card game \"Liverpool Rummy\", similar to \"Contract Rummy\" or \"Shanghai Rummy\", with special cards and simplified rules.\r\nThe objective of the game is to be the first player to complete all 10 game phases with defined card sets. However, beware: it's not easy to win on the highest difficulty level!\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Randomly generated or predefined phase goals\r\n- Configurable number of players: 2-4\r\n- Configurable game difficulty: 1-10\r\n- Configurable game speed\r\n- Undo function\r\n- Clear UI design: NO music, NO irritating avatars!\r\n- No online login required\r\n\r\nObject:\r\nTo be the first player to complete all phases/contracts. In case of a tie, the player with the lowest score is the winner. A Joker card '*' may be used to replace a number card and can also be used as any color to complete any phase.\r\nSkip cards have only one purpose: to make another player lose their turn. To use it, give the card to the player you want to lose their turn.  \r\n\r\nRuns consist of 3 or more cards in numerical order. The cards do not have to be the same colors. Joker cards can be used to complete runs.\r\n\r\nSets consist of two or more cards of the same number. Sets can include numbers from any color.   \r\n\r\nGame Play:\r\nPlayers draw a card from either the deck or the top of the discard pile at the beginning of their turn. At the end of their turn, they must discard a single card.\r\n\r\nCompleting phases:\r\nWhen you are able to fully meet the requirements of the phase, you may complete it. Additionally, you may play extra cards as you play the phase if they fit into the phase. For example, if you completed phase  '2 sets of 3' you could play three 4’s and three 6’s. You could play additional fours or sixes as part of your sets, but you could not add a different set.\r\n\r\nHitting:\r\nAfter making a phase, players may “hit” onto other phases in play. The cards you add to the completed phases must fit into the phase, and you can only hit after your own phase is in play.\r\n\r\nEnding the round:\r\nPlayers end the round by playing all of the cards from their hand. The player who goes out first wins the hand and scores zero points. The rest of the players score points (points are bad). Players who completed their phase move on to the next phase. Any players who were unable to complete their phase during the round must attempt to complete it again during the next round.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N1SB8MWVWDD","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"European War 6","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37380.13965885428590471.08381b34-0766-42dc-b06a-98ae682172ce.a4c53196-546d-454a-b9bd-7b660381830a","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36900.13965885428590471.08381b34-0766-42dc-b06a-98ae682172ce.6542f313-6453-451d-bf6d-e429d940b9c6","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6417.13965885428590471.08381b34-0766-42dc-b06a-98ae682172ce.09c8f72a-08a4-4418-b90a-d845692bb68e","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55929.13965885428590471.08381b34-0766-42dc-b06a-98ae682172ce.1b22d359-0a1c-48ca-aa21-c8d17f8f7af8","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15384.13965885428590471.08381b34-0766-42dc-b06a-98ae682172ce.60c66a7f-31ff-440b-b111-0fb495945473","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62279.13965885428590471.08381b34-0766-42dc-b06a-98ae682172ce.0d67131f-b9d3-47b3-8bb2-180cca6ebe00","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58663.13965885428590471.08381b34-0766-42dc-b06a-98ae682172ce.4af31c4b-4b01-411b-b7c1-a7fd4f869708","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50344.13965885428590471.08381b34-0766-42dc-b06a-98ae682172ce.bcb36640-c10b-4647-85be-96cdb939a723","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43675.13965885428590471.08381b34-0766-42dc-b06a-98ae682172ce.09ae653b-8959-4864-859b-cc582a09ad0b","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.7,"RatingsCount":"3","PackageFamilyNames":["34006EasyTech.EuropeanWar6_nz34nvfqxfk3r"],"ContentIds":["baba8a85-2a76-1abf-5376-cf05a5b8913b","363cb810-44f4-485d-7a03-9b74b819e1fc"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"After the end of the American War of Independence, the French Revolution \r\nbroke out in Europe in 1789.

The goal of the game is to take as many tricks as possible and reach a score of 10 or more first. The game is played in pairs. Your partner sits opposite to you and the deals are played clockwise. Each player is dealt five cards and the game starts by choosing a card suit.\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ FEATURES ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ advanced AI players\r\n✓ intuitive interface\r\n✓ balanced rules\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ TIPS ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓\tIn the first round you can choose the trump suit by choosing the card from the center pile. \r\n✓\tIf the current round passes without choosing the trump a second one follows.\r\n✓\tIn the second round you must choose any suit of cards except the one you passed in the round before.\r\n✓\tIf the trump is not chosen in these 2 rounds the cards are reshuffled and the game starts again without changing the dealer.\r\n✓\tOnce a trump suit is chosen the game can start. \r\n✓\tIf you choose a trump suit in the first round, the card in the center pile is passed to the dealer of the cards.\r\n✓\tIf you are the dealer of the cards, your name is marked with an encircled D. If the trump is chosen in the first round you receive the trump card and must shed any card you wish.\r\n✓\tThe player next to the dealer in a clock-wise direction is the first to choose a trump suit. \r\n✓\tIf that player passes the chance, the next one after him follows.\r\n✓\tThe game is played between two teams: a top-bottom team comprised of you and a computer player and a left-right team of computer players.\r\n✓\tThe player and his partner are called the makers if one of them chooses a trump suit. Otherwise they are called the defenders.\r\n✓\tTo win the makers must take at least 3 tricks. The defenders in order to win must take at least 3 tricks as well.\r\n✓\tIf the makers take 5 tricks they score 2 points. If the defenders take 3 or more tricks they score 2 points.\r\n✓\tIf the makers take 3 or 4 tricks they score 1 point. If the makers take less than 3 tricks they score 0 points.\r\n✓\tThere is the possibility of playing alone by pressing the -play alone- button when choosing the trump.\r\n✓\tWhen playing alone the team scores 4 points if the maker takes all 5 tricks. Otherwise if the team takes 3 or 4 tricks it scores only 1 point.\r\n✓\tThere is a specific order of the trump cards. The trump Jack is the most valuable card, followed by the Jack of the same-color suit. \r\n✓\tFor example if the trump suit is hearts, the most valuable card is the Jack of hearts followed by the Jack of diamonds.\r\n✓\tThese cards are followed by the Ace, the King, the Queen, the 10 and the 9. \r\n✓\tThere are only 24 cards in the deck - 6 from each suit.\r\n✓\tThe order of the cards in the other suits is the Ace, the King, the Queen, the Jack, the 10 and the 9.\r\n✓\tThe Jack of the same color as the trump suit makes part of the trump suit.\r\n✓\tYou can start the trick with any card but you must follow suit or play any other card if you cannot follow suit.\r\n✓\tThe trick is won by the player who plays the highest trump or the highest card of the starting suit.\r\n✓\tTo win the game you must be the first to score 10 or more points.\r\n✓\tThere is a statistics menu in which you can view the total games played, the percentage of won games, the number of rounds played, the number of euchres made.\r\n✓\tIf you as a defender take 3 or more tricks then you achieve a euchre.\r\n✓\tIf you as a maker take less than 3 tricks then you have been euchred.\r\n✓\tThe makers are marked with an M. The player that chose the trump is marked with a bold M.\r\n✓\tThe defenders are marked with a D.\r\n\r\n★ Support and Feedback\r\nIf you have any technical problems please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

years who learn how to read in English. \r\n\r\nThe evil Snow Queen has frozen the letters of the English alphabet and the poor animals were taken into the icy captivity. Only your smart kid can save the animals. In order to do that your child has to learn English letters and combine them into words, which represent the names of the captured animals. \r\n\r\nIt’s not a big secret that many kids can face difficulties learning to read in English, because English letters in real words have different pronunciation rules in comparison with their sounds in the English alphabet. \r\n\r\n“Learn to Read & Save the Animals” educational game offers efficient Phonics techniques in order to learn how to read in English. During the process of playing the educational game the children will hear the sound of each English letter in exactly the same way as it’s pronounced in the shown word. \r\n\r\nIt allows your child to understand the rules of English word reading on the subconscious level.

begin. Play the game you love with friends and family or get matched with other live players at your level. Trickster Euchre offers customizable rules, so you can play Euchre your way!\r\n\r\nReal People, Right Now\r\n\r\nSelect “Play” and Trickster Euchre finds other players based on skill and speed. Get started without waiting — other players join as they’re ready. After the game, “Play Again” keeps you playing with the same group.\r\n\r\nFriends and Family Included\r\n\r\nPlay together — even when you’re apart.

It’s something I enjoyed in school but, now live in a part of the country where few people are familiar with the game.”\r\n \r\n“I love how I am able to play with my friends, and I really enjoy the user-friendly interface.”\r\n\r\n“Awesome app! So nice to have a quality euchre game on my phone!”\r\n \r\n“Really nice game with great layout and user face. You can play with AI or random users, friends, and even set up games.”\r\n\r\n“Easy to see the cards on the screen – that’s important.

As any other successful game, millions of Solitaire clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We tried to recreate all the fun of original game with many card laouts in a tiny download package. \r\n\r\nThe game starts with a specific layout and one open card. Rest of the cards are on closed stack. Your aim is to move all the cards to open card. \r\n- You can move any of the open card on the three peaks to the open card if it is adjacent to it regardless of the suit. e.g. you can move a 3 or 5 in case the open card is 4. Either King or 2 can go on top of the Ace (and vice versa). \r\n- If you are unable to move any card you can open a close card. \r\n- Every time you move a card from layout to open card you get points. These points start with 1 for the first time and increase by 1 for subsequent cards. However if you open a close card the streak breaks and the point start from 1 again. Earn bonus points for left over closed cards or for fast finish.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

online version of a classic, complete with massive sieges and politics\"\r\n- GamesRadar\r\n\r\n\"Stronghold Kingdoms is probably one of my favourite MMORTS titles\"\r\n- Engadget\r\n\r\n\"A rich massively multiplayer strategy game\"\r\n- GameWatcher\r\n\r\nStronghold Kingdoms is a massively multiplayer grand strategy game and the first ever online Stronghold! Kingdoms is about forging alliances, political mind games, city-building and castle sieges with thousands of other players. Cast as a feudal lord or lady, players begin with a single village and keep. They must design and defend their castle before turning their eye to the rest of the country, Europe and the world! Whatever path they choose players will find strength in numbers as they band together, uniting with local Factions and player-led Houses.\r\n\r\nBesiege the castle that’s never been taken, overthrow ruthless tyrants, bankroll your faction’s war efforts, pillage your neighbor’s resources, peacefully raise cattle or do it all! Factions, elections, liege lords and their vassals come together to form a feudal community of real players with whom to discuss strategies and build allegiances.\r\n \r\nWhile an impregnable castle should be at the heart of any kingdom, you can also specialize with a vast research tree. Starting as a humble peasant each promotion provides valuable research points to spend on trading, diplomacy, warfare, farming or religion. Beware as your power grows so does your responsibility. Your vassals will look to you for leadership and you may find yourself fighting for the crown itself!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N8KG3V9JDQ6","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Balls Bounce Challenge","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19624.14043754788067645.89d19737-8fa1-4562-a2ad-668d0d46c2b4.16ee7145-2e26-416a-89ef-7faa7a642c71","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32164.14043754788067645.89d19737-8fa1-4562-a2ad-668d0d46c2b4.a0cf2b78-1eec-40cf-8389-fc578ec53961","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["61957Casualgame.BallsvsBricks_0nt7ynh0rqkt4"],"ContentIds":["2ff1b511-fc2b-e8f4-9a45-2b6b0f7e1567","ee785d0a-fc6e-e3d1-8348-f511e85987f3"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Balls Bricks Breaker is a simple addictive and pleasurable bricks breaker game!\r\n\r\nUse your brain and swipe the balls to break all the bricks.\r\nTry your best to clear all bricks and get higher scores!\r\n\r\nOver hundreds of challengeable levels, clear the stages by eliminating bricks on the board.
