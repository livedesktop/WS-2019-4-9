Start out playing with a single suit until you’re comfortable, and then see how you fare when using two or even all four suits in a game.\r\n\r\nFreeCell\r\nUse four extra cells to move cards around as you try to clear all cards from the table. More strategic than the Klondike version, FreeCell rewards players who think several moves ahead.\r\n\r\nTriPeaks\r\nSelect cards in a sequence, either up or down, to earn points and clear the board. How many boards can you clear before you run out of deals?\r\n\r\nPyramid\r\nPair two cards that add up to 13 in order to remove them from the board. Try to reach the top of the pyramid. See how many boards you can clear and how high you can score in this highly addictive card game!\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges\r\nPlayers receive new challenges each day. Complete enough Daily Challenges in a month to earn badges and compete with your friends.\r\n\r\nStar Club\r\nEven more challenges arranged in collections and packs you can unlock by earning stars.\r\n\r\nChoose Your Theme\r\nThe Microsoft Solitaire Collection features several beautiful themes, from the simplicity of \"Classic\" to the serenity of an Aquarium that comes to life before you while you play.

Recall your childhood!\r\n\r\nLudo game that traces its lineage to 6th century India. Ludo is derived from game Pachisi. Ludo is also very similar to Spanish board game.\r\n\r\nLudo game has stayed popular throughout the ages, varying only a little in its game structure. This persevering game is now available for you to play in an all new modernized format, i.e. as a video game application.\r\n\r\nThe game is played between 2 to 4 players and you have the option of playing the game against the computer, against your friends, or even against people from around the world. The objective of the game is pretty straightforward; each player gets 4 tokens, these tokens must make a full turn of the board and then make it to the finish line.\r\n\r\nWhoever gets all four tokens to the end first is the winner. However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided die, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a six.

Its really easy to pick up and play and difficult to put down. Its simple to play but still has a strategic component to it\r\n\r\nThe objective of Uno Card Game is to empty all your cards before the other players get rid of theirs. The player reduces cards by discarding cards that match the top card in the Discard pile.\r\n\r\nUse the special action cards to frustrate your fellow players by stealing turns away from them. Match the colour or the number of the last card on the discard stack to play your cards.\r\n\r\nUno with Friends - Card Game is a very simple color and number matching game. The deck consists of 108 cards, of which there are 25 of each color (red, green, blue, and yellow), each color having two of each rank except zero. The ranks in each color are zero to nine, \"Skip\", \"Draw Two\", and \"Reverse\" (the last three being \"action cards\"). In addition, the deck contains four each of \"Wild\" and \"Wild Draw Four\" cards\r\n\r\nEach player is dealt 7 cards and the remaining cards are placed face down to form a draw pile. The first player has to match the card in the discard pile either by number or color or the player can throw down a Wild Card else he must pick a card from the draw pile. If he can play what is drawn, great.

It is played on a square board, made of 64 smaller squares, with eight squares on each side. Each player starts with sixteen pieces: eight pawns, two knights, two bishops, two rooks, one queen and one king. The goal of the game is for each player to try and checkmate the king of the opponent. Checkmate is a threat ('check') to the opposing king which no move can stop. It ends the game.\r\nDuring the game the two opponents take turns to move one of their pieces to a different square of the board. One player ('White') has pieces of a light color; the other player ('Black') has pieces of a dark color. There are rules about how pieces move, and about taking the opponent's pieces off the board. The player with white pieces always makes the first move. Because of this, White has a small advantage, and wins more often than Black in tournament games.\r\nDeveloping Chess strategy and improving your Chess skill!

Starting with Windows 98 other version of solitaire joined the suit - FreeCell, Spider, Tri-Peaks and Pyramid. As a part of the standard Windows installation those games have been popularized around the world. For each of those games millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We combined all six games (Klondike, Spider, FreeCell, Tri-Peaks and two flavors of Pyramid) in a tiny download package. \r\n\r\nThe fun of original games is preserved but some improvement are made to make it easier to play on the small factor devices. In particular, you don't have to drag individual cards - drag&drop whole column, only proper cards will move the rest will snap back. The scoring all the games is simplified to track only number of moves to solve the puzzle. If you stuck, feel free to use hints or undo - implemented by all the games.

So, yep we mastered AI along time ago!\r\n\r\nRegardless of your playing level, ZingMagic's multi award winning Chess is a fun, stimulating and challenging game for beginners and champions alike.\r\n\r\nChess is a two player game with a colourful history which can be traced back to its Indian ancestor, Chaturanga. In 1291 the Archbishop of Canterbury in England threatened clergy who continued playing Chess with a diet of bread and water.  \r\nThe game has flourished over the years and is now one of the most popular board games in the world, requiring thought, skill and strategy to become successful.\r\n\r\nThe object of Chess is to capture the opponent's King.  To capture the King you must place it in check.  If the King cannot escape by itself, or with the help of its army, it is in checkmate and the King is captured.\r\n \r\nZingMagic’s multi award winning Chess application supports over 20 levels of play allowing you to play moves or games against the clock or relax and play at your own pace. Whatever level of Chess you choose, you can be sure that ZingMagic’s Chess will give you a fun, stimulating and challenging game.\r\n\r\nThis game is ad-funded.

As any other successful game, millions of Solitaire clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We tried to recreate all the fun of original game with many card laouts in a tiny download package. \r\n\r\nThe game starts with a specific layout and one open card. Rest of the cards are on closed stack. Your aim is to move all the cards to open card. \r\n- You can move any of the open card on the three peaks to the open card if it is adjacent to it regardless of the suit. e.g. you can move a 3 or 5 in case the open card is 4. Either King or 2 can go on top of the Ace (and vice versa). \r\n- If you are unable to move any card you can open a close card. \r\n- Every time you move a card from layout to open card you get points. These points start with 1 for the first time and increase by 1 for subsequent cards. However if you open a close card the streak breaks and the point start from 1 again. Earn bonus points for left over closed cards or for fast finish.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJ399","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Racing 3D: Need For Race on Real Asphalt Speed Tracks","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.21826.9007199266245812.0d05833b-354a-401d-a114-ae2be3746edf.bb1f7896-a4bf-4c12-8a05-b74713408591","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13834.9007199266245812.58cb4b5b-21f5-43bf-b205-111567c50c6c.17931f56-7d88-424f-970f-62f5ef82262e","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9354.9007199266245812.47f1ca5f-7020-4ff6-86e5-e8cd05bf87cc.f8eb1e55-a850-409b-bfc8-56d576b6bba8","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42748.9007199266245812.2b5d6959-6dae-43c7-9a79-abab282b1e17.2f387ab0-1c75-4616-b98d-737e836734ca","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37872.9007199266245812.eec73467-2091-49cf-9800-ccad855eb448.12f6e476-3585-49d1-b462-a8a081bb1d47","Height":434,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37922.9007199266245812.afde2046-9c2c-4399-b708-dd8dfb705bb1.f8cdba19-fe72-4076-98e6-cc5b21e2812d","Height":558,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7798.9007199266245812.275f88df-7dbf-45b4-94cd-73bce44dac19.f87972fa-9afa-493e-9471-505417caebfe","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5897.9007199266245812.40009b36-716c-4e71-aaaa-06440ca94d08.b9cd52d1-4cc1-4a70-b73f-d4de417cc1a2","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23078.9007199266245812.0b0439bc-6b0b-4751-9d10-d1c9b3c497d1.76edc4e1-fbc3-4590-84e5-eb3a93f80e42","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30557.9007199266245812.5324bf26-06e8-4c98-b082-8fa377e96e6b.3b66856c-fe03-4343-8f7f-b796d0ee7f00","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":2.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["C40DCF4F.SpeedRacing3DNeedForRaceonRealAsphaltTrac_b6sb9g8avsqk2"],"ContentIds":["df41676d-2420-e49b-35a3-80f7b991ac65","832a1732-29b4-9a9d-e44e-4cd9aa6c0e92","76bdc163-a404-10fe-5c30-1276ae7e32f8"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"First time Unique Arcade Racing Experience available on mobile devices.Test your skills driving plenty of cars on completely different tracks.

A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line. Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans.\r\n\r\nIt’s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. It’s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control. Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. Highly skilled drivers control a high powered street car past its limit, sideways at high speed, burning rubber. It can’t get any better!\r\n____________________________________\r\n\r\nSUPPORT: http://en.ratrodstudio.com/support/ \r\nVISIT US: http://ratrodstudio.com\r\nFOLLOW US: twitter.com/ratrodstudio","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9MVSJCGHBSW8","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Zumas Marble Royal","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26016.13857149684208981.6beed058-eb80-4107-a846-1462eb0c6e45.a647a94c-d47d-47ae-a1f9-cd3bba6f584d","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43334.13857149684208981.060f461c-29a4-4b61-b97c-f8de8ee0eae6.82e64525-5a20-48c8-9bdb-32545c9275c1","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26016.13857149684208981.6beed058-eb80-4107-a846-1462eb0c6e45.a647a94c-d47d-47ae-a1f9-cd3bba6f584d","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["57689BIGWINStudio.ZumasMarbleRoyal_ksj94409qacn2"],"ContentIds":["4e57289f-3d0d-7b5e-6b0a-1e21a85cac01","cb8f1289-aa1e-de83-0119-8c329a6b75b6"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Zumas Marble Royal is an amazing zuma themed puzzle game!\r\nEnjoy this simple cool zuma marble shooter game and it's very fun.\r\nFor the legendary treasure, you have to survive over 10 secret scenes in classic zuma mode.

Attack bloon-infested territory adjacent to your city, win a short tower defense game, and add the captured territory to your city as a space on which to build. Buildings are the heart of your city, and each one has a specific purpose - individual monkey towers for battle, upgrades for those towers, farms and banks to drive your economy, power to supercharge your city, epic buildings for epic powers, and decorations to make your city more awesome. Every time you build, your city looks cooler, you increase your power potential in tower defense play, and you open up even more rewards and challenges.\r\n\r\nAMAZING DEPTH AND VARIETY\r\nAll 21 of the fully awesomized and carefully balanced Bloons TD 5 towers are available within Monkey City, with completely new unlock mechanics. More than 130 buildings and decorations give you endless strategies and city design options. Explore the wilderness to find treasure tiles and uncover 11 powerful special items like the Banana Replicator and the Dark Temple Idol. Burst bloons on 55 all new tower defense maps or test your mastery on 13 wildly challenging original special missions. Either way, be ready to encounter all new bloon waves and special bloon attack patterns like Cash Starve or Fast and Furious.\r\n\r\nREINFORCE YOUR FRIENDS\r\nConnect with Facebook friends, then help each other win and expand. Send Supply Crates back and forth for bonus starting cash. Visit friends' cities to check out their strategies and their city design skills, and while you're there root out any bloon spies to win a reward for both you and your friend.\r\n\r\nSHOW OFF YOUR SKILLS\r\nBuild up the strongest lineup of monkey towers possible and compete with other players for the best score in weekly Contested Territory events. Use the latest in monkey science to send player vs. player bloon attacks, then see whose defenses are the strongest and earn extra rewards for victory.\r\n\r\nDownload for free and play Bloons Monkey City now!\r\n\r\nPlease Note:\r\nBloons Monkey City is free to download and play (aside from internet, carrier, data, device, and other services for which the player is financially responsible), but some in-game items can be purchased with real money.
