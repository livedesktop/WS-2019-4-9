10!\r\n\r\nSolitaire remains the most played computer game of all time, and for good reason. Simple rules and straightforward gameplay make it easy to pick up for everyone.\r\n\r\nSolitaire has been part of Windows for more than 25 years, and the Microsoft Solitaire Collection makes it the best experience to date with five different card games in one:\r\n\r\nKlondike\r\nThis version is the timeless classic that many people just call \"Solitaire.\" Try to clear all the cards from the table using one or three-card draw, while using traditional scoring or the Vegas scoring system.\r\n\r\nSpider\r\nEight columns of cards await your attempts to clear them with the fewest moves possible. Start out playing with a single suit until you’re comfortable, and then see how you fare when using two or even all four suits in a game.\r\n\r\nFreeCell\r\nUse four extra cells to move cards around as you try to clear all cards from the table. More strategic than the Klondike version, FreeCell rewards players who think several moves ahead.\r\n\r\nTriPeaks\r\nSelect cards in a sequence, either up or down, to earn points and clear the board. How many boards can you clear before you run out of deals?\r\n\r\nPyramid\r\nPair two cards that add up to 13 in order to remove them from the board. Try to reach the top of the pyramid. See how many boards you can clear and how high you can score in this highly addictive card game!\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges\r\nPlayers receive new challenges each day. Complete enough Daily Challenges in a month to earn badges and compete with your friends.\r\n\r\nStar Club\r\nEven more challenges arranged in collections and packs you can unlock by earning stars.\r\n\r\nChoose Your Theme\r\nThe Microsoft Solitaire Collection features several beautiful themes, from the simplicity of \"Classic\" to the serenity of an Aquarium that comes to life before you while you play. You can even create custom themes from your own photos!\r\n\r\nXbox Live Integration\r\nSign in with your Microsoft account to earn achievements, compete with your friends on the leaderboards, and track your personal gameplay statistics. If you sign in with a Microsoft account, your progress is stored in the cloud so you can play the game on any device without missing a beat!\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH18846","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Candy Crush Saga","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.44511.13510798882606697.327db134-6bc2-4f76-9a46-0720bb116b70.865c659c-b0c8-4048-8933-7bd1c60464e2","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#0a8ad3","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37233.13510798882606697.9e54a75c-7720-4cee-92a9-832f20d97b88.f04b26a3-fcc5-4b32-a590-942dc9d67971","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#0a8ad3","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.32665.13510798882606697.dd942049-0097-4757-8870-c89cd0e91409.5557eb1a-0a96-4489-ba41-9c2c8439d0df","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#0a8ad3","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60967.13510798882606697.f8b7bd99-b7d5-4fb5-be6e-c18ee6b6e8ed.9dcde191-935a-4f35-96ce-84e29a91651d","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#0a8ad3","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.22774.13510798882606697.80fe3068-e6f2-44c0-b8d2-5fac9e6efafc.aae68f6c-8d47-400c-9cc3-aa8ce3cdac58","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#0a8ad3","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53732.13510798882606697.e5d371c5-27c1-41a6-ac36-22211ef20dab.caa96e8a-ffdd-454a-8036-4896f6278fce","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#0a8ad3","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.63064.13510798882606697.11aad4ea-fc6e-4a5c-b8aa-06443dbe3d7c.06d4119f-e44c-4430-bfe8-ac849c6eb761","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#0a8ad3","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54354.13510798882606697.7a42c472-75d7-487e-9538-ebb5ce1657e6.372723d8-dd1a-450a-9fed-d420e7705e4e","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.6,"RatingsCount":"19","PackageFamilyNames":["king.com.CandyCrushSaga_kgqvnymyfvs32"],"ContentIds":["7a2f3c0a-5b57-d9e6-a895-54511dc38991","86fd8ab2-940b-dba1-ba34-7a3dad8b9b98","c0f09d0c-0ce1-2f8e-32c6-12d59b287391","e309d18b-71de-964c-b152-c82b96c2f88f"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Candy Crush Saga, from the makers of Candy Crush Soda Saga & Farm Heroes Saga!\r\n\r\nJoin Tiffi and Mr. Toffee on their sweet adventure through the Candy Kingdom.

In this derby simulator limiting car damage is key to becoming victorious and how you smash into other cars makes a big difference. Always try to smash rivals in the side of their vehicle or from the rear. Head-on collisions on the other hand should be avoided.

Build, expand, plan your strategy, the decision is in your hands!\r\nBut don’t stop there, recruit dozens of funny characters, add them to your collection and watch as they populate the streets and bring your city to life!\r\n\r\nBuild the BEST. CITY. EVER.\r\n- Craft hundreds of unique, gorgeous buildings in your city and expand it from a tiny, peaceful town to a big, bustling metropolis.\r\n- Don’t forget to decorate your skyline by building famous landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, the Tower of London or the Tower of Pisa (there’s something for every tower fan) to elevate your city to the top tourist destinations.\r\n\r\nMeet your new family \r\n- Cartoon fans rejoice! Meet and collect tons of funny characters with their own unique personalities, like the portly Sergeant Cakemore, or the uber-macho builder guy, Forest Manly (whose real skill is the tiny bit too suggestive eyebrow raise).\r\n- Build a water tower. Check! Build a fire station. Check! But who’s going to drive the fire truck? Assigning citizens to jobs will help you optimize your city, but you can go even further! Send them on missions and they won’t come home empty handed or do favors for them so they would invite their friends too to fill your city!\r\n\r\nFusion is the way to go\r\n- The future: age of smart forks, exploding hover boards, even selfies! But now the 21st century lives up to its promise, with the ability to merge buildings into advanced skyscrapers and unlock specializations.\r\n- Unlocking each allows you to develop your city towards different directions and expand your collection with specialized buildings such as Sustainability, Commerce, Education and Entertainment. Choose which one suits your strategy best!\r\n\r\nThe grass is always greener…\r\n- But is it really? Find out by visiting the cities of your friends. Is your friend the best builder you know? Well, you can always “borrow” a bit of their ideas to improve your game … sshhh, we won’t tell anyone…\r\n- In case you find yourself short on some crucial resources, visiting the Trade HQ should be a major part of your strategy, it is where you can collect some extra cash or find missing upgrade items.\r\n\r\n\r\n**** Game not optimized for Nokia 2520.\r\n\r\n_____________________________________________\r\n\r\nVisit our official site at http://gmlft.co/website_EN\r\nCheck out the new blog at http://gmlft.co/central\r\n\r\nDon't forget to follow us on social media:\r\nFacebook: http://gmlft.co/SNS_FB_EN\r\nTwitter: http://gmlft.co/SNS_TW_EN\r\nInstagram: http://gmlft.co/GL_SNS_IG\r\nYouTube: http://gmlft.co/GL_SNS_YT\r\n\r\nThis app allows you to purchase virtual items within the app and may contain third party advertisements that may redirect you to a third party site.\r\n\r\nPrivacy Policy: http://www.gameloft.com/en/privacy-notice\r\nTerms of Use: http://www.gameloft.com/en/conditions-of-use\r\nEnd-User License Agreement: http://www.gameloft.com/en/eula","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH51ZFN","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Jigsaw Puzzle Premium","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22167.13510798887642769.f0b9db38-beed-4c2f-9350-e0cac82d6ac5.cdbcf6bf-c4d3-4fc5-8f08-4335f43809b6","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#068B5C","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42961.13510798887642769.29e458a7-c33e-439b-b503-af4dcddb6e0d.eeacdbeb-1b37-4323-9e4e-aab038110e1a","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#068B5C","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44646.13510798887642769.961178c8-b8c4-4bd8-bc58-a90cbacb69dd.1c37e76c-5044-41ba-beb0-022e30cadf01","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#068B5C","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8063.13510798887642769.cc04962b-4e40-4e9c-ac9d-367a86a74803.74188d3f-c549-443e-a9a8-57ffeabdf2d8","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#068B5C","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["37936Larocque.JigsawPuzzlePremium_kgerrer9nxtm4"],"ContentIds":["a3a3c536-f3c7-ee1f-f103-5201c0e06268"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Jigsaw Puzzle Premium is great for puzzlers of all ages.

So, yep we mastered AI along time ago!\r\n\r\nRegardless of your playing level, ZingMagic's multi award winning Chess is a fun, stimulating and challenging game for beginners and champions alike.\r\n\r\nChess is a two player game with a colourful history which can be traced back to its Indian ancestor, Chaturanga. In 1291 the Archbishop of Canterbury in England threatened clergy who continued playing Chess with a diet of bread and water.  \r\nThe game has flourished over the years and is now one of the most popular board games in the world, requiring thought, skill and strategy to become successful.\r\n\r\nThe object of Chess is to capture the opponent's King.  To capture the King you must place it in check.  If the King cannot escape by itself, or with the help of its army, it is in checkmate and the King is captured.\r\n \r\nZingMagic’s multi award winning Chess application supports over 20 levels of play allowing you to play moves or games against the clock or relax and play at your own pace. Whatever level of Chess you choose, you can be sure that ZingMagic’s Chess will give you a fun, stimulating and challenging game.\r\n\r\nThis game is ad-funded.

One of the Microsoft developers noticed this version and implemented a version for Windows. It was first included with Win32s as an application that enabled the testing of the 32-bit thunking layer (does anyone remember what that was?). FreeCell remained relatively obscure until it was released as part of Windows 95. \r\nSince then the game has been ported to numerous platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We largely tried to recreate a full experience of the game in a tiny download package, including power moves, hints and undo (top right corner of the title bar). But there are also some minor twists to make it easier to play on a small factor mobile devices. In particular you don't have to select a card to move - drag and drop entire column - only appropriate cards will move, the rest will snap back. The cards will be moved to foundation automatically when possible. The scoring is also changed - only number of moves counted - the lower the score - the better. \r\n\r\nOnly the top (exposed) card of each tableau pile is available for play. It may be moved to a foundation pile, a free cell, or to another tableau pile. Within the tableau, cards are built down in sequence and alternating in color. Any card may be moved into an empty space. Blocks of cards may not be moved, unless the requisite number of free cells and/or tableau spaces are available to allow each individual card to be moved. To move part of partial pile, drag whole pile - the game will self adjust. If you fill all four foundation piles, you win. \r\nIf you don't see any more moves try hints, undo (top right corner) to back track, or menu to start new game.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJCGH","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Need for Racing: New Speed Car on Real Asphalt Tracks","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.64541.9007199266251752.264db8f9-ff10-4c7f-9132-7fe22e388174.65b3b9a5-cee2-4cd1-b8f7-a82495de58bd","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.39008.9007199266251752.0c9b99d7-5972-4f66-acbf-7993f8624a2a.7fca17dd-7ea0-4f3d-b099-764c815d2706","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.46743.9007199266251752.9bd9d013-c8bc-4df4-aa35-416131bbb7c6.06c89881-9d17-4797-80a7-1ae89e398482","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.34184.9007199266251752.a5ca945e-8951-4a29-a687-5dedb2a256d5.986befe4-6525-4cb6-bdd0-6c9fef00681d","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.21966.9007199266251752.4665982e-fb68-4ecc-8001-0ec943f9d13a.a4f3a2c6-2c2f-42f0-a6c8-79a85998b0ec","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.24691.9007199266251752.684a5527-8b37-4438-9f3b-c568055064cf.d8b2257c-07eb-47eb-8257-1fb2e63d81f5","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["C40DCF4F.NeedforRacingNewSpeedCaronRealAsphaltTrac_b6sb9g8avsqk2"],"ContentIds":["24958f99-f4bf-51e3-709e-e2844ca4f437"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Participate in high-octane racing competition in 10 different racing modes.

A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line. Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans.\r\n\r\nIt’s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. It’s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control. Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. Highly skilled drivers control a high powered street car past its limit, sideways at high speed, burning rubber. It can’t get any better!\r\n____________________________________\r\n\r\nSUPPORT: http://en.ratrodstudio.com/support/ \r\nVISIT US: http://ratrodstudio.com\r\nFOLLOW US: twitter.com/ratrodstudio","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJCJG","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Spider Solitaire Collection Free","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30186.9007199266251693.bb4553e8-86e7-4b65-a9bb-6ccdeefd7c17.7029e085-f4cb-4e12-87fa-02b34ae24bc4","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#1C9558","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.16164.9007199266251693.66ae06c0-6c6e-4e12-9ca1-a4924d81279d.89b01d1e-ced4-41aa-89a0-5394eda92e87","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#1C9558","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13860.9007199266251693.07fcfec6-96ef-4efa-ad1f-f58d3fc2cf71.54beb575-389f-4e45-8761-065ae2353863","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#1C9558","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60912.9007199266251693.22012260-3791-462d-92ff-332d36a0745e.f2c61312-addc-411f-a884-31371d573bee","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#1C9558","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9171.9007199266251693.dadf7317-414c-4739-9d67-5e0d6b1e029b.2a6ca758-fe2b-43fb-9718-976ff9c25668","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#1C9558","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4931.9007199266251693.c9425b5b-a57a-430e-a7ad-7992c64aaaee.215790f5-62b6-4aa1-bb32-5c3d80095267","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#1C9558","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22327.9007199266251693.04d1c893-44fa-4f36-9f6d-e71941f601e8.25aad5f8-30e4-4d0b-9216-6382050bcfa5","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#1C9558","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60399.9007199266251693.31a64ec2-546a-4571-9bd9-5f87f0029533.9097ab22-6ae5-480e-b833-01bc7f90409a","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#1C9558","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55753.9007199266251693.923bd944-547f-4039-81b7-88ed123a189c.cda166b8-cb6d-4628-8a7c-51782b6b6ebf","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["TreeCardGames.SpiderSolitaireCollectionFree_n666hb6ddc5jp"],"ContentIds":["b8f1098c-a6ee-4b90-e51d-1342746aafd9","9d7c8ccf-c695-298c-1f82-2d4a6c7b9645","630f6217-a186-344c-ff87-8f382dbec7ab"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Play a free beautiful collection of Spider solitaire game variations, including:\r\n- Spider\r\n- Spider One Suit\r\n- Spider Two Suits\r\n- Scorpion\r\n\r\nWe support our apps and your feedback is welcome.

Become our new recruit and download this action-packed stealth game now!\r\n\r\nJust some of the awesome features:\r\n⛬ Unique stealth play\r\nDynamics shadows and lights offering unique stealth experience\r\n⛬ Many cool gadgets to unlock\r\n ⚬ Night vision goggle\r\n ⚬ Thermal (heat) goggles\r\n ⚬ Stun gun\r\n ⚬ Electromagnetic pulse (EMP) weapons\r\n ⚬ Digital map\r\n ⚬ so much more to come\r\n⛬ Take-downs\r\nNeutralize guards and drag them out of sight\r\n⛬ Multiple campaigns with many missions\r\nSteal priceless items around the world in a full career-mode\r\n⛬ Control the environment\r\nDestroy lights, eliminate security cams\r\n\r\nThe art of stealth\r\nYou will need to operate in complete silence and remain undetected as you steal objects from the most secure locations. Avoid or neutralize guards, sneak past security cameras, and maneuver past anti-theft security laser pointer systems. It's all part of your daily occupation as a notorious thief.\r\n\r\nThe key to completing successful missions in this stealth game is remaining undetected. Use the shadows and any tiny corner to your advantage. You often have multiple options to a situation, will you take-down a guards or will you simply sneak by. While missions can be completed whilst detected, the true art of stealth is to achieve 100% stealth scores for your missions.\r\n\r\nGame-play TIPS\r\n1. Use the dark shadows\r\nWatch your stealth visibility indicator at the bottom/right of the screen closely to see how visible you are. By staying in the dark shadows you will remain invisible to the guards and this allows you to sneak past them undetected.\r\n2. Use gadgets wisely\r\nAs you complete missions you're arsenal of gadgets and gear expands, but your resources remain limited. Use your ammunition wisely throughout the missions as you may come cross critical situations when you will desperately need your weapons.\r\n3. Drag guards into the shadow\r\nTo avoid any later detection of knocked out guards you need to be sure to drag them out of sight into a dark corner or behind cover. Detection of a guards leads to the alarm being raised and will negatively impact your stealth % score.\r\n4.
