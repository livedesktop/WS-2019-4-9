10!\r\n\r\nSolitaire remains the most played computer game of all time, and for good reason. Simple rules and straightforward gameplay make it easy to pick up for everyone.\r\n\r\nSolitaire has been part of Windows for more than 25 years, and the Microsoft Solitaire Collection makes it the best experience to date with five different card games in one:\r\n\r\nKlondike\r\nThis version is the timeless classic that many people just call \"Solitaire.\" Try to clear all the cards from the table using one or three-card draw, while using traditional scoring or the Vegas scoring system.\r\n\r\nSpider\r\nEight columns of cards await your attempts to clear them with the fewest moves possible. Start out playing with a single suit until you’re comfortable, and then see how you fare when using two or even all four suits in a game.\r\n\r\nFreeCell\r\nUse four extra cells to move cards around as you try to clear all cards from the table. More strategic than the Klondike version, FreeCell rewards players who think several moves ahead.\r\n\r\nTriPeaks\r\nSelect cards in a sequence, either up or down, to earn points and clear the board. How many boards can you clear before you run out of deals?\r\n\r\nPyramid\r\nPair two cards that add up to 13 in order to remove them from the board. Try to reach the top of the pyramid. See how many boards you can clear and how high you can score in this highly addictive card game!\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges\r\nPlayers receive new challenges each day. Complete enough Daily Challenges in a month to earn badges and compete with your friends.\r\n\r\nStar Club\r\nEven more challenges arranged in collections and packs you can unlock by earning stars.\r\n\r\nChoose Your Theme\r\nThe Microsoft Solitaire Collection features several beautiful themes, from the simplicity of \"Classic\" to the serenity of an Aquarium that comes to life before you while you play. You can even create custom themes from your own photos!\r\n\r\nXbox Live Integration\r\nSign in with your Microsoft account to earn achievements, compete with your friends on the leaderboards, and track your personal gameplay statistics.

It is fundamentally different from most solitaire games in that very few hands are unsolvable. Although software implementations vary, most versions label the hands with a number (derived from the random number seed used to generate the hand).\r\n\r\nA version of FreeCell was created by Microsoft for release with the Windows operating system.\r\n\r\nFreeCell solitaire is one kinds of funny solitaire card game, but it's not like other solitaires. You need no luck to win, only skill is required. All cards are opened from the start and the deal has the solution, you can win, think and move wisely. \r\n\r\nKey Features: \r\n- deals with different difficulty \r\n- every completed deal has score \r\n- customizable background and card \r\n- magnetic card movement \r\n- supermove: multiple card dragging \r\n- drag or tap to move \r\n- undo option \r\n- optimized battery usage for very long gameplay \r\n\r\nRules\r\nConstruction and layout\r\nOne standard 52-card deck is used.\r\nThere are four open cells and four open foundations. Some alternate rules use between one to ten cells.\r\nCards are dealt into eight cascades, four of which comprise seven cards and four of which comprise six. Some alternate rules will use between four to ten cascades.\r\n\r\nBuilding during play\r\nThe top card of each cascade begins a tableau.\r\nTableaux must be built down by alternating colors.\r\nFoundations are built up by suit.\r\n\r\nMoves\r\nAny cell card or top card of any cascade may be moved to build on a tableau, or moved to an empty cell, an empty cascade, or its foundation.\r\nComplete or partial tableaus may be moved to build on existing tableaus, or moved to empty cascades, by recursively placing and removing cards through intermediate locations. Computer implementations often show this motion, but players using physical decks typically move the tableau at once.\r\n\r\nVictory\r\nThe game is won after all cards are moved to their foundation piles.\r\nVarious computer versions of Freecell occasionally deal unsolvable games.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nOne of the oldest ancestors of FreeCell is Eight Off. In the June 1968 edition of Scientific American, Martin Gardner described in his \"Mathematical Games\" column a game by C. L. Baker that is similar to FreeCell, except that cards on the tableau are built by suit rather than by alternate colors. Gardner wrote, \"The game was taught to Baker by his father, who in turn learned it from an Englishman during the 1920s.\" This variant is now called Baker's Game. FreeCell's origins may date back even further to 1945 and a Scandinavian game called Napoleon in St. Helena (not the game Napoleon at St. Helena, also known as Forty Thieves).\r\n\r\nPaul Alfille changed Baker's Game by making cards build according to alternate colors, thus creating FreeCell. He implemented the first computerised version of it in the TUTOR programming language for the PLATO educational computer system in 1978. Alfille was able to display easily recognizable graphical images of playing cards on the 512 * 512 monochrome display on the PLATO systems.\r\n\r\nThis original FreeCell environment allowed games with 4–10 columns and 1–10 cells in addition to the standard 8 * 4 game. For each variant, the program stored a ranked list of the players with the longest winning streaks. There was also a tournament system that allowed people to compete to win difficult hand-picked deals. Paul Alfille describes this early FreeCell environment in more detail in an interview from 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\nSolver complexity\r\nThe FreeCell game has a constant number of cards. This implies that in constant time, a person or computer could list all of the possible moves from a given start configuration and discover a winning set of moves or, assuming the game cannot be solved, the lack thereof. To perform an interesting complexity analysis one must construct a generalized version of the FreeCell game with 4 * n cards. This generalized version of the game is NP-complete; it is unlikely that any algorithm more efficient than a brute-force search exists that can find solutions for arbitrary generalized FreeCell configurations.\r\n\r\nThere are 52! (i.e., 52 factorial), or approximately 8*1067, distinct deals. However, some games are effectively identical to others because suits assigned to cards are arbitrary or columns can be swapped. After taking these factors into account, there are approximately 1.75*1064 distinct games.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH1NTVK","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Play Football kicks","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59551.13510798885969526.51e4bebb-30ee-4ce9-81c8-8a9f10990672.ae99d5d1-0d8d-45c7-bf5d-1f7c567eb440","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2103.13510798885969526.078f8451-9362-4c11-9f54-7591a6e86702.48188406-a542-4aa5-8c46-b6eb83fee3f2","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["50154AVLogix.PlayFootballkicks_q7ke2emr2nmbw"],"ContentIds":["387f2144-2bfd-7800-9b66-848bbf35a751","4ad21b1b-3ac2-f886-29f6-0d585ca54efc"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Soccer is an ancient game which were started over hundred years ago.

The new versions of the game are much brighter and diverse. Retris is one of the best in our opinion, although one can find dozens of Bricks, Blocks, Pentomino and 1010!-like games in the Internet. But it is still essentially the same game that was originally Quadris (classic puzzle Tetris).\r\n\r\nYou can choose number of figures – 9 as in the classical version; 11 – a mix of three and four bricks; Pentax, 17 – all the figures. You can moderate type of figure movement (fluent/intermittent), initial speed, figure colors (as in Tetcolor). At the same time there are no frills, and classic Tetris and Tetcolor lovers might grow fond of it.\r\n\r\nRetris has two color modes: in the first one all pieces of a certain type consist of blocks of the same color. The bottom part that is not burned is composed of disparate units if mixed colors - the remnants of the thrown shapes.\r\n\r\nThe second mode is when a falling figure is composed of red blocks, and the bottom blocks (made of the fallen ones)  are blue.\r\n\r\nRetris provides an opportunity to show a transparent grid that divides a figure into blocks.\r\n\r\nThe game can show a “phantom” – an identical “twin” of a falling figure to help you see where it is better to place it.\r\n\r\nOne can choose a mode of control type in Quadris: if you prefer to play holding your smartphone or tablet with two hands, you can select a mode in which the control buttons are situated to the left and to the right from the game field.\r\n\r\nThere is also an option \"play with one hand\" in Quadris, the control buttons are placed to the right from the playing field on your smartphone or tablet screen.\r\n\r\nYou can compete with other players as in many other puzzle games. It is possible to play anonymously or to register and get your unique nickname. After that your results get into the global chart.\r\n\r\nEnjoy the auto-save function if your game is interrupted by a call or any other program switch on the smartphone!\r\n\r\nHow to play:\r\n- Create horizontal lines using the falling blocks;\r\n- When you make a line of blocks, it is cleared from the screen;\r\n- The game is over when the blocks pile up and reach the top of the screen;\r\n- You get more points for completing multiple lines at once.\r\n\r\nYou can play the new version of Quadris either online and offline. The game may be of interest both to adult fans of the classic Tetris game and to attract the younger generation, it is as easy to use as educational online games.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon of classic puzzle games – Tetris and other related puzzle games like Quadris, Pentax, etc. – has been repeatedly studied by scientists. If one believes their opinion, downloading a free puzzle game (like Quadris or Tetris), you get both a free shrink and a free nutritionist – it is believed that classic puzzle and logic games may relieve stress, may help to ease one’s condition after psychological problems and may reduce the risk of overeating by switching attention to the game.

CITY. EVER.\r\n- Craft hundreds of unique, gorgeous buildings in your city and expand it from a tiny, peaceful town to a big, bustling metropolis.\r\n- Don’t forget to decorate your skyline by building famous landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, the Tower of London or the Tower of Pisa (there’s something for every tower fan) to elevate your city to the top tourist destinations.\r\n\r\nMeet your new family \r\n- Cartoon fans rejoice!

Check! Build a fire station. Check! But who’s going to drive the fire truck? Assigning citizens to jobs will help you optimize your city, but you can go even further! Send them on missions and they won’t come home empty handed or do favors for them so they would invite their friends too to fill your city!\r\n\r\nFusion is the way to go\r\n- The future: age of smart forks, exploding hover boards, even selfies! But now the 21st century lives up to its promise, with the ability to merge buildings into advanced skyscrapers and unlock specializations.\r\n- Unlocking each allows you to develop your city towards different directions and expand your collection with specialized buildings such as Sustainability, Commerce, Education and Entertainment. Choose which one suits your strategy best!\r\n\r\nThe grass is always greener…\r\n- But is it really? Find out by visiting the cities of your friends. Is your friend the best builder you know? Well, you can always “borrow” a bit of their ideas to improve your game … sshhh, we won’t tell anyone…\r\n- In case you find yourself short on some crucial resources, visiting the Trade HQ should be a major part of your strategy, it is where you can collect some extra cash or find missing upgrade items.\r\n\r\n\r\n**** Game not optimized for Nokia 2520.\r\n\r\n_____________________________________________\r\n\r\nVisit our official site at http://gmlft.co/website_EN\r\nCheck out the new blog at http://gmlft.co/central\r\n\r\nDon't forget to follow us on social media:\r\nFacebook: http://gmlft.co/SNS_FB_EN\r\nTwitter: http://gmlft.co/SNS_TW_EN\r\nInstagram: http://gmlft.co/GL_SNS_IG\r\nYouTube: http://gmlft.co/GL_SNS_YT\r\n\r\nThis app allows you to purchase virtual items within the app and may contain third party advertisements that may redirect you to a third party site.\r\n\r\nPrivacy Policy: http://www.gameloft.com/en/privacy-notice\r\nTerms of Use: http://www.gameloft.com/en/conditions-of-use\r\nEnd-User License Agreement: http://www.gameloft.com/en/eula","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH5L29S","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Virtual Families 2: My Dream Home","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22889.13510798887157993.e0459097-4c3a-40a7-92d9-50ef9120c3a0.463bc715-defc-490e-9db3-10446435ca98","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29905.13510798887157993.4e33b8a2-349e-4d43-a46b-75a0f634e2c8.f11b7d75-325d-4dd3-b466-6784475d390f","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.5,"RatingsCount":"2","PackageFamilyNames":["LastDayofWork.VirtualFamilies2MyDreamHome_d532r1j86my6c"],"ContentIds":["2e756912-5577-b1d9-f710-8e549858dd8f","56cf66cc-0bd4-6cde-7aca-da5aa14e7e49"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Virtual Families 2: Our Dream House\r\nThe sequel to the smash hit is finally here!\r\n\r\nAdopt a little person from the thousands of choices of little people who live inside your computer.
