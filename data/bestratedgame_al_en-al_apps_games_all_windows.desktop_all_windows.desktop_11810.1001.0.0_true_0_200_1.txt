Recall your childhood!\r\n\r\nLudo game that traces its lineage to 6th century India. Ludo is derived from game Pachisi. Ludo is also very similar to Spanish board game.\r\n\r\nLudo game has stayed popular throughout the ages, varying only a little in its game structure. This persevering game is now available for you to play in an all new modernized format, i.e. as a video game application.\r\n\r\nThe game is played between 2 to 4 players and you have the option of playing the game against the computer, against your friends, or even against people from around the world. The objective of the game is pretty straightforward; each player gets 4 tokens, these tokens must make a full turn of the board and then make it to the finish line.\r\n\r\nWhoever gets all four tokens to the end first is the winner. However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided die, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a six. Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player’s token lands on the same square as your token, then your token will automatically be sent back home and you’ll need to roll a six again.\r\n\r\nLudo King is a game that was played by kings and now it can be enjoyed by you and your family and friends. While the game play might seem simple at first, the game is immensely enjoyable and challenging. You’ll be playing this one for hours and its fun for the whole family. Try to beat your opponents and compete for the highest scores on the leaderboards.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJ3WT","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Dominoes","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18526.9007199266246296.e4c5b9ab-2c6d-4888-ae4b-ebf71f4fb8eb.ac622a2f-9a0c-4e43-b207-efae263402d6","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#2F447A","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61706.9007199266246296.44c386d9-c724-4a89-a40d-62229597ac38.22d5f10a-ae4f-46df-ac03-cfb459ea84ab","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#2F447A","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45696.9007199266246296.fdfb9843-99dc-4dd2-a3b6-8e286a38b766.fbf8b50e-9c40-44d5-9675-85e8ee685e73","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#2F447A","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36095.9007199266246296.25b328a1-41a9-4ab6-8dde-ea6c4a36a9a4.4b96ed69-702b-4ec1-b194-a78bd5bd778e","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#2F447A","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.181.9007199266246296.94b07bb2-0b44-427d-9537-9067ad754f7c.b233ee2e-630d-4623-9b77-c5160815039b","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#2F447A","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61816.9007199266246296.87396c8a-5d9e-4869-b333-7f1a584390fd.b4995062-1a82-4c7e-9a38-237399174d1b","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#2F447A","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51012.9007199266246296.f0d85151-e5ec-4e06-8aa5-75d454b99e17.8f3fc714-3834-4c7d-8761-4bf874642754","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#2F447A","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43587.9007199266246296.07d38db8-de95-496b-b295-38bdd83359f1.4b2ed967-ed3a-45d7-a955-9d7256834f95","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#2F447A","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27296.9007199266246296.1cde8d16-6c7b-4760-851e-6ab0aeca5cb5.39f946e2-e01c-41b5-b0f2-24fa3cbd7331","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#2F447A","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.3,"RatingsCount":"3","PackageFamilyNames":["26720RandomSaladGamesLLC.Dominoes_kx24dqmazqk8j"],"ContentIds":["bc36f400-8974-8089-5685-01da2b9000ad","69263955-e6a6-a796-6687-495a2321d0b0","b586c98a-49d9-cbb7-1b51-ab55a15c3891"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Play the BEST dominoes game for Windows today!\r\n\r\nEnjoy the simple pleasures of this classic game on your computer, laptop, or tablet.

Keep in mind though that you are among the wilds and trying to eat what would have ended up as the lion’s food. You have to hunt the deer before getting to the loins or you will lose the hunt and the lions can you.\r\n\r\nYou will see beautiful sceneries like wildlife, forest and mountains in the game and enjoy the sounds of weapons, lions, birds and family of Red & Mole dear's.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDHB8P","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Perfect Shift","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38015.9007199266339250.0f8aef31-84a2-49e5-b275-4b415af9801b.0937569e-abcd-4a95-a393-fab39f9dff35","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54139.9007199266339250.11f46f4a-88a2-4d18-a6ee-093ef44fccde.1081b795-923d-43a7-b33f-6b65815bc73b","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.55628.9007199266339250.e20fe469-ca50-49bd-8fc2-1a92315635db.58c75688-e45d-40ba-a3ff-267e40c0c9fa","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.7,"RatingsCount":"3","PackageFamilyNames":["Lextre.PerfectShift_j7ch1pvxn64yc"],"ContentIds":["658cfc8b-c6eb-6fcc-769b-5850067bd7fb","b5c26436-4eb8-1ad7-019c-c64e8bbeaa62","081ed016-2973-572d-1e38-bd9e2abb45ed"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"*** Windows Phone Store Spotlight Featured & Top Ranked in All Markets ***\r\n\r\n«A fantastic game to fill your need for speed» - Windows Central\r\n\r\n«One of few must-have apps for your new tablet and smartphone» - Daily Star\r\n\r\n«A visually stunning drag racing game» - WinBeta\r\n\r\nList of Top-100 apps: «a fantastic looking drag racing game» - Lumia Conversation UK\r\n\r\n***Due to popular demand, the Perfect Shift soundtrack can also now be downloaded on xBox Music, so you can listen to your favourite tunes from the game even when you’re not playing!***\r\n\r\nThis high-octane Perfect Shift game lets you compete with challengers in a visually stunning 3D race environment that looks great on any device.\r\n\r\nChallenge the toughest opponents to race in abandoned tunnels, on deserted city streets and dark industrial areas.

The deep snow in the winters has made it difficult for people to move around and tourists are also planning skiing trips and you have to transport the passengers and ski gear to offroad deep snow mountain tracks. Drive the snow tourist bus and pick n drop the passengers. You also have to pick the tourists from snowy hill resorts to city. Deep snow has made it very difficult & dangerous to drive on the narrow roads of the city and off road tracks have become even more risky. Make sure you don't hit the traffic and people on the road as it is really cold due to snow blizzards and the roads have become narrower. Snowy Bus Drive is a challenging game testing driving skills in risky and dangerous conditions and difficult paths. Hill drivers are really experts in cutting those hilly corners and curves but snow adds to the risk and challenge. Tourists in the mountain top resorts are depending for their survival on you so that they can reach the city safe and sound. Be the best snow bus driver on city and off-road conditions.\r\n\r\nUse the controls to accelerate and brake according to the conditions. Drive carefully and make sure you can see your way in the snow and control the bus on the skiddy ice. It is like a thin sheet of glass on the roads. Everything is covered in snow from the hill tops & mountain to roads to houses to hotels. The met department has reported that the snow storm is likely to keep at this pace for many days to come and people cannot use their cars to travel in this weather. Since you are one of the only few bus drivers providing the transport services in these tough hilly conditions on off-road and city roads, you have to be fast and rush to your destination to pick as many passengers as possible. People are depending upon you to reach their homes for Christmas and New Year. You are an expert snow driver who can make all this happen.\r\n\r\nYou have multiple game play missions in hilly off road conditions to complete so be ready for the kicks and excitement. Just launch into the game and drive away and you have to make sure you are driving safe. You will experience both city and off-road environment and view many scenic views of mountains and hills while you are driving in the snowy conditions. Drive the extreme snow bus drive away!\r\n\r\nWe hope you enjoy the game.
