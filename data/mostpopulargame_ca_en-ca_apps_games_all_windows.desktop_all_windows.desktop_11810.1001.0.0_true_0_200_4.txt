As any other successful game, millions of Solitaire clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We tried to recreate all the fun of original game with many card laouts in a tiny download package. \r\n\r\nThe game starts with a specific layout and one open card. Rest of the cards are on closed stack. Your aim is to move all the cards to open card. \r\n- You can move any of the open card on the three peaks to the open card if it is adjacent to it regardless of the suit. e.g. you can move a 3 or 5 in case the open card is 4. Either King or 2 can go on top of the Ace (and vice versa). \r\n- If you are unable to move any card you can open a close card. \r\n- Every time you move a card from layout to open card you get points. These points start with 1 for the first time and increase by 1 for subsequent cards. However if you open a close card the streak breaks and the point start from 1 again. Earn bonus points for left over closed cards or for fast finish.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N0DMW7WVXCF","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Business City: Monopoly Board Game","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40067.13926985617920864.7d027ac3-fcfb-4d34-a632-7498c35b448c.973c6b2a-986d-4400-9cb0-1b0e46f7b546","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50448.13926985617920864.7d027ac3-fcfb-4d34-a632-7498c35b448c.f3d29eeb-7a7b-4970-ba94-4b1420fed9e3","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47119.13926985617920864.7d027ac3-fcfb-4d34-a632-7498c35b448c.522e6ee9-d59c-4ac7-8c6a-2636d59ab2d0","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["44206SilentMonkGames.448740C1676C_9nr9yt7wn1prj"],"ContentIds":["3f9b059c-5566-33d0-01d5-2283dc33f9cd"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Embark on a journey to own it all - The Business City: Monopoly Board Game!

It's also a great way for grownups to clear one's mind, or get into that trance or meditative state when thoughts can ramble around as they want.  \r\nYou can play Wall Ball in standard mode, with a pretty fast ball, or in easy mode with a rather large and slower moving ball, or you can even play in seated mode, suitable for people with some physical impairment or if you just feel very tired.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL STUFF:\r\nBefore starting the game, Make sure you have the Kinect camera (sensor) properly installed on your computer. Follow instructions from Microsoft website to install Kinect and the necessary SDK software  http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44561 \r\nTo use Kinect for Xbox One on your computer, you need the Kinect Adapter for Windows. After installation of the Kinect software you should be able to see the Kinect for Windows SDK v2.0 in your app menu. \r\nFind a good spot to play where the Kinect camera can view you from head to feet. You can easily check this with the software that follows with the installation of the Kinect SDK software. You can for instance run Kinect Studio v2.0 (under Kinect for Windows SDK v2.0) to view yourself in front of the Kinect.\r\nIf everything looks ok, then you can start the Wall Ball game.\r\nIt can be recommended to connect your computer to a larger monitor or TV screen (using a HDMI cable) to  improve the \"feel\" of the game and making it easier to see.\r\n\r\nGENERAL SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS:\r\n•\tFree the space around you to not hurt yourself or to break any furniture. (Think about arms could be waving upwards too.)\r\n•\tIf children are playing they should be supervised and instructed by parents to not hurt themselves bumping into furniture.\r\n•\tIf other people are present in the room, make sure they are not in front of the camera and that they are at a safe distance from you bumping in to them.\r\n•\tIf you experience problem with balance, consider sitting down when playing.\r\n\r\nQUICK START\r\nBefore you start, make sure Kinect is properly installed and you have tested a good spot for playing where the Kinect sensor can \"read\" you properly, see above under \"Technical stuff\". If you have two graphic cards on your system, run the game with the better card otherwise it can affect Kinect/game performance. (For example, if you have a nvidia card you can manage this in nvidia control panel, manage 3D settings.)\r\nStart the game by pressing the Wall Ball icon.\r\nFrom the Main Menu (start screen), choose one of the three game variants Standard or Easy version or if you would like to sit down and play, choose Seated mode. The ball is somewhat larger and slower in Easy and Seated mode.\r\nWith the Toggle Show Settings (down at the right corner), you can adjust for your camera's placement above the floor. It is recommended to fine tune this. If the camera height setting are too low, you will feel like your feet are really heavy and won't lift properly. If it's to high, your feet will float in the air. The camera height slider correspond to the Kinect sensor's placement above the floor, however if it is tilted, you may have to adjust the slider more.\r\nStand in front of the Kinect camera, let the camera know you're there by moving slightly. When camera has found you, start kicking.\r\nKick the ball by using your right or left foot. When aiming, remember this is virtual reality so aim in a real world scale, not just in a small tv screen scale, that is, play like you were in the park yourself facing a large wall about 4 meters in front of you.\r\nIf the ball touches the area right behind you (an area as wide as the yellow area you're standing on) you will lose one ball. \r\nTo prevent the ball from hitting this area, you can stop the ball with your \"body\", shown as a silhouette, or just use your feet. You can slide from side to side inside the yellow area and crunch (you can't really move forward or backward, only as far as your legs can reach).\r\n\r\nIf you have lost all of your five balls, the game will end and you can choose to save, restart or exit. You choose between alternatives by putting your foot in one of the boxes, in this way you can restart instantly if you would like without the need to reach for the computer. You can also click on the signs with the mouse. From the Start screen, you can click on Result Menu where you can view your results.\r\n\r\nVideo tutorial: https://youtu.be/qFTv-q2cccg\r\nPDF tutorial: http://www.mixxusstudio.com/game-production/kinect-games\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N1X7QVFM874","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Texas Hold'em Poker Online -

If the King cannot escape by itself, or with the help of its army, it is in checkmate and the King is captured.\r\n \r\nZingMagic’s multi award winning Chess application supports over 20 levels of play allowing you to play moves or games against the clock or relax and play at your own pace. Whatever level of Chess you choose, you can be sure that ZingMagic’s Chess will give you a fun, stimulating and challenging game.\r\n\r\nThis game is ad-funded.

For those that want a puzzle that lasts more than a few minutes. And now an unlimited supply of automatically generated 9 x 9 Sudokus for when you want a quick puzzle.\r\n\r\nThe Samurai and Super Sudokus come in three levels of difficulty, none of them are trivial or easy.  These are Sudoku that will take a bit of time to solve.  And if you complete one you will have solved it.  There are no cheats or hints to allow you to carry on if you get stuck. The 9x9 Sudoku come in four levels of difficulty with the most difficult requiring slightly harder solving techniques than the larger puzzles.\r\n\r\nThere are aids to help with some of the legwork though, the Sudoku will auto fill and update pencil marks showing all of the possible numbers available in each square and you can highlight all squares that can hold a possible number allowing patterns to be seen.  But, there is nothing in the Sudoku to shortcut the mental process required to complete it.\r\n\r\nThe list of Sudoku now shows whether automatic pencil marks or number highlighting have been used and the best time for each Sudoku will reflect this, if you complete a Sudoku without using assistance this will be recorded as your best even if it was slower than a previous attempt where assistance was used.\r\n\r\nThe Sudoku auto save so you can have several on the go at any time.\r\n\r\nAlso for traditionalists or the masochistic you can email a Sudoku to your computer to be printed out and solved the hard way with no highlighting assistance using a pen and paper.\r\n\r\nBecause of the size of the Sudoku this app will work best on a PC, tablet  or large screen phone.  However, the grid can be zoomed so play on almost any device should be possible with a pit of patience.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NVWCJLD51MK","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Hidden Object : Siberian Princess","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24708.14456668529899584.2c9021e3-b068-4a78-9bc9-f7cc54ef196d.9fc17969-2c2a-409b-81d9-81f3809e2c86","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#333333","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30882.14456668529899584.2c9021e3-b068-4a78-9bc9-f7cc54ef196d.cc4f0245-e28c-4e49-a1b5-ceb6407183e2","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#333333","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29347.14456668529899584.2c9021e3-b068-4a78-9bc9-f7cc54ef196d.f12e2da2-f8c1-4868-a8ce-6a614aa6047d","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#333333","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.786.14456668529899584.2c9021e3-b068-4a78-9bc9-f7cc54ef196d.43e88c97-ce49-4554-a5a7-0596ab9fc4d5","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#333333","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"CAD $2.49","Price":2.49,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["63539WhatYJ.HiddenObjectSiberianPrincess_snqt1gdtj7vq4"],"ContentIds":["1353c624-c9ae-08b8-d5fd-d524c9d0b4fd","43744d91-0311-4e72-8987-4f84568b5e12"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"An addictive hidden object game about siberian princess.\r\n\r\nFind and spot the given hidden object.\r\n\r\nAnfisa is the daughter of the head of a small village.

Each stack must start with an Ace, followed by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen and end with a King. \r\n✓ At the beginning of the game, all the cards are dealt into 8 columns. At the top of the screen you will find 4 free cells and 4 foundations. Use the free cells to temporarily store one card at a time during the game.\r\n✓ Once you place a card in the foundation you cannot take it back. Make sure you no longer need it before placing it there.\r\n✓ You can move a card from one column to another if the top card from the other column is +1 higher and is of a different color. For example, you can put a 3 of hearts over a 4 of spades. Or you can put a 10 of clubs over a Jack of diamonds.\r\n✓ You can move an entire series of cards if you have enough free positions. Empty columns and empty free cells are considered free positions. The series of cards must be smaller or equal than the number of free positions plus 1. For example, if you have 2 empty free cells and one empty column you can move at most 4 cards at a time.\r\n✓ If you cannot move a stack because it is too large you can try splitting it into two parts. Then you can reassemble it in a new column.\r\n\r\n\r\n★ Support and Feedback\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

It is well worth trying to arrange such avalanches, as they will give you ten times more points than ordinary bursts.\r\nAnother important rule to know is that the borders are like mirrors. If you shoot a bubble towards an exposed border, it will not stick to the border but will bounce right back like a stream of light against a mirror. This feature becomes really handful when the center of your board is filled up with and you need to shoot some bubbles on the sidebars.\r\nIf your tap fails to detonate any bubbles, you get a foul, and when there are several fouls, one or two new line of bubbles appears at the top. The number of misfires allowed before bubbles will advance again, is shown by the number of silver ball in the left bottom corner.\r\nThe game is over when you clean all the bubbles off and your score doubles, or bubbles move all the way down on you.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N97SMMM9QHK","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Scarlett Mysteries: Cursed Child","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51580.13537477620250516.e410fa6f-6301-4f0b-8922-3918b02537af.73b1792d-18c4-4930-ad3c-0ac45f42497e","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.2,"RatingsCount":"143","PackageFamilyNames":["ArtifexMundi.ScarlettMysteriesCursedChild_xmkq9zz36w32m"],"ContentIds":["849f2a8b-fe1a-c350-4625-dd8dfaf1b23c","e5aa5b6b-0588-1199-e4e8-c66e4a14ca52","56adbdee-6856-8b73-25f2-fa58d9a9a832","ff62b6f0-6e1b-64c6-5ffe-d31014a2ad28"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"FANTASTIC HIDDEN OBJECT PUZZLE ADVENTURE GAME FROM THE CREATORS OF ENIGMATIS AND GRIM LEGENDS!\r\nFrom an early age, Scarlett Everitt displayed a gift for the paranormal, as ghosts and spirits accompanied her every step.

variation of popular card game \"Liverpool Rummy\", similar to \"Contract Rummy\" or \"Shanghai Rummy\", with special cards and simplified rules.\r\nThe objective of the game is to be the first player to complete all 10 game phases with defined card sets. However, beware: it's not easy to win on the highest difficulty level!\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Randomly generated or predefined phase goals\r\n- Configurable number of players: 2-4\r\n- Configurable game difficulty: 1-10\r\n- Configurable game speed\r\n- Undo function\r\n- Clear UI design: NO music, NO irritating avatars!\r\n- No online login required\r\n\r\nObject:\r\nTo be the first player to complete all phases/contracts. In case of a tie, the player with the lowest score is the winner. A Joker card '*' may be used to replace a number card and can also be used as any color to complete any phase.\r\nSkip cards have only one purpose: to make another player lose their turn. To use it, give the card to the player you want to lose their turn.  \r\n\r\nRuns consist of 3 or more cards in numerical order. The cards do not have to be the same colors. Joker cards can be used to complete runs.\r\n\r\nSets consist of two or more cards of the same number. Sets can include numbers from any color.   \r\n\r\nGame Play:\r\nPlayers draw a card from either the deck or the top of the discard pile at the beginning of their turn. At the end of their turn, they must discard a single card.\r\n\r\nCompleting phases:\r\nWhen you are able to fully meet the requirements of the phase, you may complete it. Additionally, you may play extra cards as you play the phase if they fit into the phase. For example, if you completed phase  '2 sets of 3' you could play three 4’s and three 6’s. You could play additional fours or sixes as part of your sets, but you could not add a different set.\r\n\r\nHitting:\r\nAfter making a phase, players may “hit” onto other phases in play. The cards you add to the completed phases must fit into the phase, and you can only hit after your own phase is in play.\r\n\r\nEnding the round:\r\nPlayers end the round by playing all of the cards from their hand. The player who goes out first wins the hand and scores zero points. The rest of the players score points (points are bad). Players who completed their phase move on to the next phase. Any players who were unable to complete their phase during the round must attempt to complete it again during the next round.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PLKGTQ40LHN","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Town Building Games: Tropic City Construction Game","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4658.14311983258152889.5fac71d5-3f87-439d-9ddd-d8ae31ef1030.1339f59e-fba4-4f32-9196-0dd22478866b","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48214.14311983258152889.5fac71d5-3f87-439d-9ddd-d8ae31ef1030.38bb3336-5f40-4983-bb67-5bd30e122993","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50967.14311983258152889.5fac71d5-3f87-439d-9ddd-d8ae31ef1030.8c32a144-9ad1-48f0-953c-7dbee45c1572","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4180.14311983258152889.5fac71d5-3f87-439d-9ddd-d8ae31ef1030.2cfb77f4-ae0f-4dcb-bad7-ad39e1f1ec94","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38715.14311983258152889.5fac71d5-3f87-439d-9ddd-d8ae31ef1030.a58b93f5-ea93-482c-9dfc-ac837341f850","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1448.14311983258152889.5fac71d5-3f87-439d-9ddd-d8ae31ef1030.3080e07f-cdd2-45f0-802d-9bec9f77fb17","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30794.14311983258152889.5fac71d5-3f87-439d-9ddd-d8ae31ef1030.b306b73b-ba2f-4b56-979b-0611d81d5c2e","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61479.14311983258152889.5fac71d5-3f87-439d-9ddd-d8ae31ef1030.1268fe24-eb14-47ba-9849-634b241b032f","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31022.14311983258152889.5fac71d5-3f87-439d-9ddd-d8ae31ef1030.58e1690d-ef19-4fce-ab6f-5a3c9ab5c136","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64841.14311983258152889.5fac71d5-3f87-439d-9ddd-d8ae31ef1030.708bcc9c-c0c6-4965-a0fc-0cdff4856079","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["SparklingSociety.TropicTown_cechnmvjdb364"],"ContentIds":["ae876fa4-bbdb-647a-dce1-545b83cbe9c5","e35f2421-b5b2-175c-5f51-d803b21f78bf"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"For city building lovers: Escape to a tropical island bay and build the town village of your dreams!\r\n\r\nA new city building construction simulator game is on its way to your device.

This annual event has become a drawing card for treasure hunters from all over the town, where everyone can benefit as both a buyer and a seller.\r\n\r\nExperience has shown that this garage sale is one of the most successful in the country. Karen, Sarah and Thomas are customers at our neighborhood garage sale. Consistently finding the good stuff at yard sales is their mission. Like any mission, it requires strategy. They have prepared themselves how to choose their target, plan their attack, assemble the necessary gear, and get in and out fast. They even made a map which lists locations and categories of what is being sold at each location.\r\n\r\nNow they are starting their search around the site for shopping and bargaining. A bargain is almost guaranteed on garage sales.

Each stack must start with an Ace, followed by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen and end with a King.\r\n✓ At the beginning of the game, all the cards are dealt into 8 columns. At the top of the screen you will find 4 free cells and 4 foundations. Use the free cells to temporarily store one card at a time during the game.\r\n✓ Once you place a card in the foundation you cannot take it back. Make sure you no longer need it before placing it there.\r\n✓ You can move a card from one column to another if the top card from the other column is +1 higher and is of a different color. For example, you can put a 3 of hearts over a 4 of spades. Or you can put a 10 of clubs over a Jack of diamonds.\r\n✓ You can move an entire series of cards if you have enough free positions. Empty columns and empty free cells are considered free positions. The series of cards must be smaller or equal than the number of free positions plus 1. For example, if you have 2 empty free cells and one empty column you can move at most 4 cards at a time.\r\n✓ If you cannot move a stack because it is too large you can try splitting it into two parts. Then you can reassemble it in a new column.\r\n\r\n\r\n★ Support and Feedback\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

Also known as Patience Klondike.\r\n\r\nTaking a shuffled standard 52-card deck of playing cards (without Jokers), one upturned card is dealt on the left of the playing area, then six downturned cards (from left to right). On top of the downturned cards, an upturned card is dealt on the left-most downturned pile, and downturned cards on the rest until all piles have an upturned card. The piles should look like the figure to the right.\r\n\r\nThe four foundations (light rectangles in the upper right of the figure) are built up by suit from Ace (low in this game) to King, and the tableau piles can be built down by alternate colors, and partial or complete piles can be moved if they are built down by alternate colors also. Any empty piles can be filled with a King or a pile of cards with a King. The point of the game is to build up a stack of cards starting with 2 and ending with King, all of the same suit. Once this is accomplished, the goal is to move this to a foundation, where the player has previously placed the Ace of that suit. Once the player has done this, they will have \"finished\" that suit- the goal being, of course, to finish all suits, at which time the player will have won.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9P2NBXKBXNVM","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Mahjong Connect Classic","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53918.14554350436144232.57191994-231e-4a29-b739-55a5585706d3.2e77586c-f875-428a-a389-e89eea4a53d0","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59353.14554350436144232.57191994-231e-4a29-b739-55a5585706d3.ae7a0eda-2683-4ceb-bb0c-2771f8f15bbd","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"74","PackageFamilyNames":["21991UltimateGameStudios.MahjongConnectClassic_k39fsxpt7ww1y"],"ContentIds":["55b37503-150d-ebfb-9b4f-9bfec9dafdfb","7aae170e-c42e-5e28-50db-742bb0411624"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Your goal in this classic Mahjong connect game is to earn as many points as you can!

Recall your childhood!\r\n\r\nLudo game that traces its lineage to 6th century India. Ludo is derived from game Pachisi. Ludo is also very similar to Spanish board game.\r\n\r\nLudo game has stayed popular throughout the ages, varying only a little in its game structure. This persevering game is now available for you to play in an all new modernized format, i.e. as a video game application.\r\n\r\nThe game is played between 2 to 4 players and you have the option of playing the game against the computer, against your friends, or even against people from around the world. The objective of the game is pretty straightforward; each player gets 4 tokens, these tokens must make a full turn of the board and then make it to the finish line.\r\n\r\nWhoever gets all four tokens to the end first is the winner. However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided die, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a six. Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player’s token lands on the same square as your token, then your token will automatically be sent back home and you’ll need to roll a six again.\r\n\r\nLudo King is a game that was played by kings and now it can be enjoyed by you and your family and friends. While the game play might seem simple at first, the game is immensely enjoyable and challenging. You’ll be playing this one for hours and its fun for the whole family. Try to beat your opponents and compete for the highest scores on the leaderboards.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PNKZMQZB3B6","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"FINAL FANTASY XV WINDOWS EDITION Playable Demo","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26141.14342353077090777.1124a8e3-eca5-4fcf-8954-f1de9abe3d07.097a46ea-43c4-4cb0-85b4-56259ba33776","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32039.14342353077090777.4907acea-1c1b-446d-8fc6-b1ed6c18a765.408b0717-cbdb-4ee6-87c9-a2693e5b16b8","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63699.14342353077090777.7c48ecf1-23a0-4878-9cf6-35f4ce812f30.4aa58422-0033-4998-b414-ad2b25741603","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60640.14342353077090777.162cf0e1-1dd0-420a-a347-2fb30ce6c670.08a45f05-11f1-4e18-8dda-10e77424b206","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.6,"RatingsCount":"19","PackageFamilyNames":["39EA002F.FINALFANTASYXVWINDOWSEDITIONPlayableDemo_n746a19ndrrjg"],"ContentIds":["73eb8c7c-e164-6cff-e4d2-e96c3b8f4dfe"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Get a sneak peek into how it all starts with the demo version of FINAL FANTASY XV WINDOWS EDITION.\r\n*Spec may differ from the product version. \r\n\r\nTake the journey, now in ultimate quality.

Every Kakuro game can be solved through logic alone. \r\n\r\nAll puzzles have been tested and have a solution - if you get stuck in any particular board and think there is no solution, reset the board and start over. You will manage to find the correct solution if you open your mind and explore different paths.\r\n\r\nReal Kakuro puzzle is a very elegant game, providing fabulous gameplay experience with 2000 unique games in 5 different difficulty levels.

Clear stages to unlock new balls.\r\n\r\nONE HUNDRED PINS\r\n\r\nKnock down as many pins as you can in 5 throws at a rack of 100 pins!\r\n\r\nCANDLEPIN BOWLING\r\n\r\nInvented in 1880. Candlepin bowling offers a great challenge. Candlepins are thin skittles that bounce and spin unpredictably when struck. Pins aren't cleared between rounds allowing you to knock them into still upright pins.\r\n\r\nFIVE PIN BOWLING\r\n\r\n Invented in 1904 in Canada. In 5 pin, each pin is worth different point values. Spares are strategic attempts to hit the most valuable pins. A perfect game is 450 points!\r\n\r\nNINE PIN (GERMAN BOWLING)\r\n\r\nInvented in medieval Germany, 9 pin is what most later bowling games are based on. Nine pins are arranged in a diamond shape with a \"kingpin\" in the middle. Knocking all the pins over earns 9 points. Knocking all the pins over but the kingpin earns 12!\r\n\r\nLONG ALLEY SKITTLES\r\n\r\nKnock over pins by throwing a barrel-shaped 'cheese'! To score points, you first have to knock over the kingpin. It's tricky to master when the ball bounces unpredictably!\r\n\r\nDUCK PIN\r\n\r\nInvented in 1904 in New England. Duck pin uses the nearly the same rules as 10 pin, but allows 3 rounds to knock over all the pins. The ball and pins are smaller making precision very important to score well!\r\n\r\nIRON PIN\r\n\r\nIron pin is the same as normal bowling but one random pin is much heavier than the others. Careful consideration has to be made on how to knock over the heavy pin while also clearing the normal ones.\r\n\r\nSHUFFLE BOWLING\r\n\r\nBowling on a shuffleboard table! Knock over the pins with a weighted puck.\r\n\r\nWEST COUNTY SKITTLES\r\n\r\nTraditional skittles game that has been played in British pubs for centuries.\r\n\r\nGalaxy Bowling has an option to purchase Candlepin, Duck Pin, Five Pin, Nine Pin, 100 pin, and Iron Pin variants. Ten pin, and spares mode are included free.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

If the ranks combine to 13, both cards will move to the Foundation. Kings, being rank 13, move to the Foundation immediately upon being touched.\r\n\r\nIf you like to relax with solitaire or puzzle games then we think you'll love Pyramid Solitaire*.\r\n\r\nThe object of the game is to remove pairs of cards that add up to the total of the highest card in the deck from an arrangement of cards - a pyramid of 28 cards.\r\n\r\nWhen using the common French deck, Jacks value at 11, Queens 12, and Kings 13. So the highest value is 13. In the numbered Spanish deck the highest numbers are also the Kings at 12, so the pairs must add up to 12.\r\n\r\nTo set up the pyramid, deal one card face up at the top of the playing area, then two cards beneath and partially covering it, then three beneath them, and so on till you have dealt out a row of seven cards for a total of 28 cards dealt. Refer to image.\r\n\r\nThe remaining cards are placed to the side face down. This is the Stock.\r\n\r\nTo play, pairs of exposed cards can be removed to the Foundation if their values total 13 (12 if using the Spanish deck). Thus, kings can be removed immediately to the Foundation. Cards must not be covered. Thus when an Ace rests on a Queen, that Queen can not be removed.\r\n\r\nYou may draw cards from the Stock one at a time and match it with any exposed card. if no match is made the drawn Stock card is still discarded into the Foundation.\r\n\r\nOnce the Stock is exhausted and/or no more pairs can be made, the game ends.\r\n\r\nTo score, count the number of remaining face up cards in the pyramid. A perfect score is therefore zero, where all cards have been matched into the Foundation.\r\n\r\nConditions for winning\r\n\r\nTo be considered won, all cards (cards from the pyramid and cards from the stock) must be moved to the foundation; the game cannot be won if at least two cards cannot be moved from the stock.\r\n\r\n\r\nVariations\r\n\r\n-Relaxed Pyramid Solitaire: to be considered won, all cards from the pyramid must be moved to the foundation; the game can still be won with cards left in the stock.\r\n-Redeals may or may not be allowed.\r\nThree cards at a time from the stack, repeating until no matches can be made; placing all -cards totalling 13 in a stack.\r\n-Alternatively, seven cards are dealt below the pyramid. These cards can match each other exposed cards in the pyramid or from the stack.\r\n-Another addition is playing Pyramid Solitaire with a cell, filled either from the tableau or from the waste upcard.\r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\n\r\n+ addictive gameplay\r\n+ enchanting graphics set in Ancient Egypt\r\n+ simple controls, easy to learn\r\n+ atmospheric sound effects\r\n+ a well made free solitaire game!\r\n+ Unlimited Undo \r\n+ Detailed Statistics","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NVS9K44SRF0","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Hair salon for girls","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57618.14393086368025669.4636a2aa-8c40-4258-83b1-6d16df30f3d8.473fd0bc-7d35-457a-bc2c-b9fd9f48ac43","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34057.14393086368025669.c78ef946-09db-4b93-9204-aceb029c6073.21f8551a-b3f6-4e53-b27f-8beea3eb2b0d","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.6,"RatingsCount":"15","PackageFamilyNames":["35237JoyJourney.Hairsalonforgirls_rqmgvvvsy2kse"],"ContentIds":["604e2a8f-9d99-a3ac-b6f8-cc22b83b17ef"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"The most beautiful and exciting hair salon games, Magic Hair Salon is coming now!

Play against 1 to 3 computer opponents. Match pieces with the same number of dots.\r\n\r\nThe game begins by shuffling the dominoes and dealing a hand to each player. With two players, each one starts with 7 dominoes, with more players, each one starts with 5 dominoes. The player with the lowest double in their hand makes the first move. \r\n\r\nExcept for Block dominoes, if a player cannot make a move, they must draw dominoes from the boneyard until they get a domino that they can play. A player who cannot make a move and cannot draw because the boneyard is empty \r\nor they are playing Block dominoes, must pass their turn. \r\nIn All-Fives dominoes, If a domino is played and the sum total of all four sides is a multiple of 5, the player earns those points.\r\n\r\nThe round is complete when a player plays all of their tiles, or when a game is blocked and no more moves can be made. At the end of a round, the player with the lightest hand (least number of dots on their remaining dominoes) \r\nwins a point bonus - sum of all of their opponents dominoes minus any dominoes still left in the winner's hand.\r\n\r\nTo move tap a domino you want to place. If there is only one place it can go, game will place it automatically. Otherwise tap or drag-and-drop it to the connecting domino.\r\n\r\nThis free version is supported by 3rd party ads.
