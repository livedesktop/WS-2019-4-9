planet.\r\nYou will be a lovely employee of this big kinder garden where you will have to take care of many hyper active children.\r\nYour task is to make them feel at home and to make them sleep once in a while. The problem is that there are always new children coming into the room that want to play, run, jump, scream and just don’t want to keep quiet. Try to make these noisy babies sleep and have a sweet dream.\r\nTo make the babies sleep you will have to tap on those having the same pajama and see them disappear in a love blast. It is basically a match 3 game. The difference is that you will have to be very quick in finding the right combinations as the room is getting too narrow to keep so many babies. If you are too slow the babies will not be able to get any rest. Keep an eye on the babies light status while playing to understand if you are doing well or if the room is getting jam packed and the babies are not able to get their nap anymore.\r\n\r\n★★★Features: ★★★\r\n- Match 3 or more identical babies\r\n- Colorful graphics and smooth animations\r\n- 15 levels to play\r\n- Realistic baby sounds\r\n- Maximum points reachable with one move: 300\r\n\r\nUseful advice: You need to match at least 3 tiny babies to get points, if you touch just 2 of them they will disappear and empty the space they occupied before, but without giving you any points.\r\n\r\nWarning: If you touch in a place where no matching babies are, you will lose 50 points.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile you are proceeding through the levels, you will find a more and more messy room. In fact there will be toys spread all over the floor which will restrict the living space of these nice little kids, such as a ball, a colorful ring tower, a yellow duck, a green rubber hedgehog, a tender teddy bear etc. Try to master all the levels of this cute baby game and become the best nanny that this sunny kinder garden has ever had.\r\nUse all of your love to make these tiny babies sleep and make them vanish in a sweet heart blast.\r\n\r\nThis Babsy baby style app is a great baby game / kids game and one of the best children games!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

optimized for preschool and elementary school children.\r\nI have created this app for my own child and have been constantly upgrading it.\r\nThe app has three modes “Triplets” game, “Training” and “Colouring”.\r\n \r\nThe “Triplets” game helps understand and memorize addition and subtraction within ten. The child is given three digits and two operators and has to compose the case him/herself.\r\nWhat’s so special about it? The child visually memorizes the case itself and can see what will happen if he changes the digits. Now there is no need to scissor out paper digits. The program itself indicates whether or not your child has composed the case right.\r\n \r\n“Training” is an easy-to-handle tool for effective instruction of your child. Forget about countless slips of paper with cases written on them! Everything is right here: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. After solving the problem the results are saved and can be seen on the stats page, the graph represents the results and the number of errors. This helps to track the dynamics of learning.\r\n \r\nOnce your child has learnt to solve the cases, you won’t have to study with him. After the solving you will always be able to see the way he or she has solved it.\r\n \r\nToday there is no app with similar functionality.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDFXVX","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"School of Dragons","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15266.9007199266295351.e8984498-bda3-45a6-85ca-e0f9c2521411.65ac06a1-ae8e-4f85-8c7b-375327cdbd58","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45198.9007199266295351.e8984498-bda3-45a6-85ca-e0f9c2521411.54df4feb-fda2-4a33-8021-064abf2c9249","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31331.9007199266295351.e8984498-bda3-45a6-85ca-e0f9c2521411.4e8218f1-0746-477e-9e10-e457dae68a12","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["0D86EB60.SchoolofDragons_sxb412dacz86t"],"ContentIds":["455a27f0-8e5e-39db-6255-afb876a5e3be","c5b0aae8-d973-e90e-6bf3-b2073b75c2d3"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Fly fast, train hard, and learn well to become the Ultimate Dragon Trainer!

Blackjack is a comparing card game between a player and dealer and played with one or more French decks of 52 cards.\r\nThe player is dealt an initial two card hand with the option of drawing cards to bring the total value to 21 or less without exceeding it, so that the dealer will lose by having a lesser hand than the player or by exceeding 21. Since the 1960s, blackjack has been a high profile target of advantage players, particularly card counters, who track the profile of cards yet to be dealt, and adapt their wager and playing strategy accordingly. While in our implementation we do not teach counting, we do offer basic strategy hints to train you on how to improve your odds.\r\nMany rule variations of BlackJack exist.

An early variant of Tic-tac-toe was played in Roman Empire, around the first century BC. It was called Terni Lapilli and instead of having any number of pieces, each player only had three, thus they had to move them around to empty spaces to keep playing. The game's grid markings have been found chalked all over Rome. However, there is some evidence to suggest that Tic-Tac-Toe could originate back to ancient Egypt. \r\nThe different names of the game are more recent. The first print reference to \"noughts and crosses\", the British name, appeared in 1864. The first print reference to a game called \"tick-tack-toe\" occurred in 1884, but referred to \"a children's game played on a slate, consisting in trying with the eyes shut to bring the pencil down on one of the numbers of a set, the number hit being scored\". \"Tic-tac-toe\" may also derive from \"tick-tack\", the name of an old version of backgammon first described in 1558. The U.S. renaming of noughts and crosses as tic-tac-toe occurred in the 20th century. \r\nWhen playing against a phone, human player is always 'O'. The player who succeeds in placing three respective marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. Using menu button, game can be configured to play on the larger boards to connect 4 pieces, or between 2 people.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDMLVN","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Bad Nerd - School RPG","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42124.9007199266448791.fa0f079b-e09a-4f6f-b62c-750d93c49e04.c67d47ed-c550-4153-b2ca-abd4c540ad7f","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37851.9007199266448791.38f4e3d1-2a40-46ed-8922-da8f66fc0a8f.b25a6a7b-fec8-494f-97ad-6d2dd7054196","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["VNLEntertainmentLtd.BadNerd-SchoolRPG_xaadq54jk5f4e"],"ContentIds":["9c1b78c6-a5f1-37dc-2e3a-5e8b7dfc5188","1bc338f0-29e1-673b-8b47-bd665e2370be"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"NOTE: This game requires touch input and does not support mouse and keyboard.\r\n\r\nSee a nerd unleash the nerd rage like never before!\r\n\r\nIf you are a fan of modern action RPGs with lots of fighting then you will love Bad Nerd!\r\nJoin Bad Nerd in his quest to rid the school of bullies!

10!\r\n\r\nSolitaire remains the most played computer game of all time, and for good reason. Simple rules and straightforward gameplay make it easy to pick up for everyone.\r\n\r\nSolitaire has been part of Windows for more than 25 years, and the Microsoft Solitaire Collection makes it the best experience to date with five different card games in one:\r\n\r\nKlondike\r\nThis version is the timeless classic that many people just call \"Solitaire.\" Try to clear all the cards from the table using one or three-card draw, while using traditional scoring or the Vegas scoring system.\r\n\r\nSpider\r\nEight columns of cards await your attempts to clear them with the fewest moves possible. Start out playing with a single suit until you’re comfortable, and then see how you fare when using two or even all four suits in a game.\r\n\r\nFreeCell\r\nUse four extra cells to move cards around as you try to clear all cards from the table. More strategic than the Klondike version, FreeCell rewards players who think several moves ahead.\r\n\r\nTriPeaks\r\nSelect cards in a sequence, either up or down, to earn points and clear the board. How many boards can you clear before you run out of deals?\r\n\r\nPyramid\r\nPair two cards that add up to 13 in order to remove them from the board. Try to reach the top of the pyramid. See how many boards you can clear and how high you can score in this highly addictive card game!\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges\r\nPlayers receive new challenges each day. Complete enough Daily Challenges in a month to earn badges and compete with your friends.\r\n\r\nStar Club\r\nEven more challenges arranged in collections and packs you can unlock by earning stars.\r\n\r\nChoose Your Theme\r\nThe Microsoft Solitaire Collection features several beautiful themes, from the simplicity of \"Classic\" to the serenity of an Aquarium that comes to life before you while you play. You can even create custom themes from your own photos!\r\n\r\nXbox Live Integration\r\nSign in with your Microsoft account to earn achievements, compete with your friends on the leaderboards, and track your personal gameplay statistics.

But for the past few months, our detective has been hot on the trail of the demonic preacher she fought one year ago. Yet he has managed to always stay one step ahead. \r\n\r\nShe hoped to bring an end to the chase in the redwood forests of Northern California. But like so many times before, the trail went cold… \r\n\r\nThen she encountered an abandoned camper in the middle of the highway. Enormous claw marks scored the roof and the lost family’s personal belongings were scattered everywhere. All signs pointed to the scene being fresh. \r\n\r\nAnd all clues led into nearby Ravenwood Park…\r\n\r\nWalking through the park gates, the detective feels the weight of invisible eyes watching. Sinister shadows lurk behind the park’s enchanting scenery and the wary glances of its overly-polite employees. Is this place connected to Maple Creek, and the preacher? \r\n\r\nWho is the mysterious prisoner she meets on the forest path – someone stalking her every move, or a possible ally? Is she merely a puppet being used in forces from outside our world, or will she finally resolve the evil events that began one year before?","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJCG8","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Shopping Cart Hero 3","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40021.9007199266251759.c3242002-c3b1-4179-8f7b-7d9672921eb0.1d9cc552-a980-4410-8572-57b66675ba34","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#0F6D87","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47567.9007199266251759.8ecff69d-1685-4d3e-bc66-3fb3628fa7d8.7a1b9d61-0acc-42b4-b5f0-dcac2fa1db46","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#0F6D87","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["MonkeyWantBanana.ShoppingCartHero3_wqtp7yr9d8y40"],"ContentIds":["b248492b-50c3-a95a-9078-06412ccc4b73","31d63499-0f05-babd-0973-e70e54a32296"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Shopping Cart Hero 3 returns with more action than ever before!  \r\n\r\nAn addicting jumper that will keep you coming back for more, Shopping Cart Hero 3 takes the adventure to all new locations to jump and explore.
